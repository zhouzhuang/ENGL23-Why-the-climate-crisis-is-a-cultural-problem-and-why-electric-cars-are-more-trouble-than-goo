 One statistic that was eye-opening for me in this lecture was the fact that “a manufactured car is already equivalent to releasing two metric tons of CO2.” This means that even if we buy a car and never use it, we have already reached the maximum amount of emissions we can contribute on a yearly basis, excluding housing, food, and everything else. That is crazy. This solidifies my view that there is no future in cars when it comes to preventing the climate crisis. I remember viewing Tesla as a zero-emission car that will not leave any carbon footprint. How naive was I to believe that this statement was true. I did not account for the manufacturing process of a car and the discovery of how much CO2 is emitted from this process is depressing. The depressing realization that technological advances may seem cool on the surface, but requires a deep dive into the process and its actual impacts on the climate. I know people who are obsessed with their cars and will spend loads of money customizing, painting, and maintaining their cars. I didn’t give much thought as to why or how we developed a culture that favors cars rather than public transportation. I will admit that in suburban areas and even cities, public transportation can be dreadful. The current public transportation system in the United States is slow, unorganized, chaotic, and potentially dangerous. However, the benefits we can gain from all using public transportation is massive. The statistic that “buses, subways, and trains can carry an individual 300, 500, and 750 miles per gallon”, respectively, is amazing. The history Professor Ken provided about the United States following WWII does a good job explaining why we are so engrossed in our cars.

 I believe that tech innovations alone will not be the solution to the climate crisis. I very much agree with Professor Ken when he states that we need to change our cultural practices to reduce our global footprint. By using cars as an example, Ken points out how technologically, electric cars are not reducing the impacts to the point where it will make a significant difference. If we want to be serious about climate change, humanity needs to make drastic changes to our cultural lifestyles. Therefore, I believe that both technological advances and cultural changes must be made in order for us to make an impact on the climate crisis. STEM scientists, social scientists, and every individual in society need to be aware and work together to tackle the climate crisis.

I totally agree with what you say about the numbers and stats. In fact, the part that left me with a strong impression this time is the statistics.  I cannot be shocked more by the staggering numbers and the calculations that Professor Hiltner led us thinking about: So if we want to hold the temperature rise in the range of 1.5~2 degrees according to the COP21, every one of us should only emit no more than 2 metric tons of CO2 per year. But only the production part of a normal automobile will emit 22 metric tons, which, if averaged to the normal life span 11 yrs of a car, is 2 metric tons per year. That means only parking your car alongside the road will exhaust all your available CO2 emissions! And not mention other factors like food, clothes, housing, or even driving the car! However, let’s see the figures for mass transportation. A bus can transport one person 350miles away for only one gallon! The subway is 20 times more and Passenger is 30 times!  Thus, exposed to the great difference between statistics, I am definitely swayed to the side of taking public transportation. And actually, for so many disadvantages of owning a car--traffic dangers, financial burdens, and environmental pollution, I really don’t think or consider the car culture as cool in our generation. And trying to use technology to lower emission is just putting the incidental over the fundamental. Therefore, we should consider the problem culturally and reengineer the car culture in our era.

Hello , yeah I was baffled when I heard the fact about having a car in a garage all year would still release 2 tons of CO2.  Cars are all over the world and are extremely accessible. Although public transportation is an option, individuals still resort to driving automobiles. Cities like New York, Madrid, and London offer an efficient network of buses, trains and subways that make getting from point A to point B trouble-free. If we want to see a world with fewer cars, we must able to provide transportation networks that make it as convenient as using cars. Electric cars were introduced as innovating vehicles that could serve as transportation while also being eco-friendly. However, this is not the case since it takes more energy to produce electric cars than it would make a regular gasoline-fueled car.

<br><hr>

I felt very similarly when watching this lecture video, and almost ashamed to have thoughtlessly failed to consider what goes into manufacturing a car. And, the saddest part is that I think with people realizing this as well, little change would be evoked. The numbers Ken mentioned actually astonished me. I know that public transportation is significantly more eco-friendly than driving your own car to transport, but I didn't know it was to this extent. I have been surrounded by people obsessed with the "cool' car culture, investing so much into cars and even their love for cars prompting them to constantly drive for purposes other than transportation. Living further away from my school community, I would often use public transportation to get around. I understand that public transportation can be inconvenient to work around the bus schedule, untimely when they're off schedule, and just sometimes hard to deal with. But, I have also been on public transportation to get home from Santa Barbara that is more sophisticated, easier to navigate, and not a pain at all to use. I truly believe that public transportation can get to this level, of a more user-friendly, reliable, organized form of travel.
<br><br>
Hopefully, with improvements like these would encourage more people to use the bus because I know if I were to ask people why they choose to drive their car when a bus can get them to their destination for much cheaper and more eco-efficiently, they would simply answer that their car is just all-around more comfortable to be in. I think it is very possible to create this similar feeling with public transportation, and if there could be implementation towards safer and more organized public transportation, we may actually be able to see a difference in our lifestyles.

Hello! A great response you had. I was also deeply shocked at how much Co2 the manufacturing of an electric car emits! I used to think electric cars were the key to solving the climate crisis, but after last quarter and researching for my environmental ethics paper, I now think differently. One, like you said there is no future for cars and Ken really did point light to how unsustainable a 5000LB vehicle is for taking one person to one place. THere are now 1 billion cars around the world, that's crazy. 
<br><br>
There's one point in your comment I really want to hit home and that's technological innovations not being the solution to climate crisis but rather a shift in cultural norms. I find it complete garbage that people see vegans and vegetarians as a 'cult' implying a negative connotation to it. That those people are crazy and it is unrealistic when in fact those people are actually living how they want the world to be and how they would want others to act. I think we need to rid of the culture negativity and stereotypes around being vegan for one that is an example of changing the cultural norm. Second, some of the research I have done on comparing reducing beef consumption to driven miles on the road is staggering and think everyone should know. Research done by the environmental working group compared meat consumption emissions to automobile emissions. "If your four-person family skips meat and cheese one day a week, it’s like taking your car off the road for five weeks" and "If everyone in the U.S. ate no meat or cheese just one day a week, it would be like not driving 91 billion miles — or taking 7.6 million cars off the road." We forget that when consuming things, like meat, or ordering anything from amazon, there are a ton of emissions purely in the transportation of that product to get to you. That's why buying less stuff is a huge way to reduce your emissions. This is the same reason why when someone says the U.S. has reduced their emissions in the past few years, don't buy it. We have moved our production to china, where everything is manufactured for a low monetary price and a very high emissions price as it travels to the U.S. I know if everything we purchased from China and all the transportation and manufacturing emissions were counted towards the U.S. and not China, we would be the number one emitter. We've have literally outsourced our emissions. Our insane consumer demand is fueling China to keep emitting to keep up with our supply. As seen with the lowering meat compared to miles taken off the road statistics, individual choices to reduce consumption can make a big difference. This has to be a cultural shift towards individuals believing they can make a difference and forming a community around environmental individual action while at the same time putting grassroots pressure on politicians to make difference at the policy level. This is going to make your life a bit less convenient yes, but this slight inconvenient is so worth the reward of making the planet habitable for you and your kids and two living up to values of treating others how you would want to be treated (imagine you were born in 50 years and the planet was ruined and you lived a life full of suffering and lacked basic resources, didn't even have clean air because the climate got so out of hand).

I was also so surprised that not driving the car at all would still end up releasing a good amount of CO2 into the atmosphere. Cars are the most popular form of transportation in America, and this makes me upset because we give so much power to the car industry in America that it does not allow public transportation to even have a chance to grow. Public transportation around the world is extremely developed, and millions and billions of people rely on public transportation, which definitely lessens the carbon footprint that those people would have if they owned a car. My family has owned electric cars for the past 6 years, and it is surprising to me that electric cars are still pretty horrible for the environment. I always heard that disposing a hybrid car battery is extremely bad for the environment but I was not aware that it was the same for fully electric cars. I agree that the current transportation system in America is actually embarrassingly horrible. A country that is as developed as the USA should not be lacking this much in something as simple as public transportation. We give way too much power too the automobile industry and it is genuinely scary.

I really agree with your idea about cars and social science. Just as what you say, the fact that only buy a car without using it emits the maximum amount of of green house gas. This renews my knowledge that using cars will cause climate crisis, but just manufacturing cars can emit a lot of green house gases, which means that we do not just need to fight against using cars, but also creating cars. However, although creating electrical cars can also create green house energy, if people must own a car, a electrical one can be a much better choice.
<br><br>
From my point of  view, science and social science are equally important for saving the climate crisis. With science, maybe there can be some kind of new renewable energy for us to use, or even find some kind of new way of manufacturing, which can help solving the problem of emission during manufacturing. At the same time, I also think that culture and social science thing is another thing which can be equally important. With the change of mind and culture, less and less people will want to buy new cars. In order to do this, informing more people the fact of climate crisis is the most important thing.
<br><hr>
Yeah, this has actually caused me to resent cars. Last year when I was taking Engl 22 and I first heard just how horrible cars are for the environment, I actually started to use more mass transit systems as a result. As someone who actively goes home every weekend to visit my family, I began to realize how much I was contributing to the environmental process by driving home every weekend. So I actually started using buses and trains to come back and forth. Honestly, it makes me happy to know that just changing up something small like my transportation method, can positively impact the world. My parents don’t understand why I don’t want to drive, it’s hard to explain that these death-traps are not only taking human lives but also destroying our planet. We have a big family at home so we have to resort to large cars to go anywhere together, and knowing that the production process of our car already costs over 22 metric tons is really depressing. I know so many people who hate driving, especially in LA, so I know that if our mass transit systems were properly funded and improved that more people would be willing to take them. Simply making more biking paths could be a simple solution as well. There are already cities in the US, like NY that rely on these systems so I really think they should be spread throughout the country. Mass Transit systems would also lead to more socialization and a sense of community if we actually think about it.

I agree in that nearly all the stats within the video. What really blew my mind was that the number of cars in America can wrap around the planet 31 times. But I also agree with your statement on culture. I just don't think its as easy as said especially when living in a state like California. I think it is unpractical to teach within our cultural values to use public transportation. While public transportation is available its nearly impossible for everyone to be able to use it. I think if the elimination of cars is going to be in our future there needs to be a better public transportation system. I understand that cars are simply 'cool' in the united states but I really believe that new transportation styles can easily take over as a new trendy topic.  Places like portland and new york are already doing it, we just need to expand this all over the united states. Ultimately I too agree with Ken when he says that technological change will not alone be the solution to the climate crisis, but I do believe a change in the public transport system in the long run be will very beneficial


<br><hr>
It also shocked me that just keeping a car in your garage can be detrimental to the climate. When I think about trying to help the environment, my immediate thought is driving less and biking more. At home, I try to bike whenever I can because I always thought that it would help make a difference. Little did I realize during the time that I’m biking and attempting to help the environment, the car sitting in our driveway is negating the efforts that I’m putting in. It’s important to spread the message that the manufacturing of cars has greater consequences than driving the car itself. Even if an individual goes electric, the cost of manufacturing the electric car already put he/she at the maximum amount of CO2 that they should be emitting per year. 

<br><br>

Technological advancements can only take society so far. I also agree that changing our cultural practices needs to be at the forefront of our climate change agenda. I believe that changing the culture of advertising is an important first step. I can’t even begin to explain how many car commercials people see on a daily basis. I’ve seen a ridiculous number of car commercials, and most of the time I see the same one over and over again. It’s gotten to the point where I can memorize the jingle in the commercial or the slogan of the car company. We’re brainwashed to believe that cars are the most amazing invention due to the advertisements we see on a daily basis. It’s important to change this social culture that stems from advertising.

I definitely agree most of your opinions. When talking about electric cars before watching this lecture video, I thought they are beneficial for the environment because they do not depend on gasoline. However, Ken’s lecture informs me that the problems with cars involve their production, which emit at least about 20 metric tons of CO2. Even if we don’t drive them, we already generate so much burden for the earth. Moreover, as a Chinese student, I am also shocked by the statistic that Chinese car owners increase by 10000% in three decades. But this number is not that surprising, because I always see crowded cars on the road in every city in China, and many cities suffer from haze because of so much green house gas emission. Furthermore, I realize how incredibly sustainable public transportations are: Bus is 14 times more efficient than cars, while subway is 20 times more so, and a passenger train is 30 times more so. These powerful statistics definitely render me good reasons to choose public transportation more frequently.
<br><br>
    However, as regarding to Ken’s discussion about New York city and how people living in the NYC commute by public transportation, I don’t think it is doable in many cities in U.S., such as Goleta. First, New York city is rather small and crowded, there is no enough space for people to drive, which could be one of the reasons they don’t drive cars. More importantly, NYC equips with highly developed public transportation system such as subway, so that people choose this convenient and reliable transportation method. In Goleta, there’s no subway. The bus system is slow and relative primitive and it doesn’t have access to many places. I think the premise for people to choose public transportation is that it is efficient for them to commute. Therefore, I don’t think people living in cities like Goleta should be blamed because of driving, since that’s the only efficient way for many of them. But I really hope that government could pay attention to the construction of public transportation system so more people would choose this environmental-friendly way.

Im so glad you brought this to attention, and judging off the amount of replys this comment has received already, It is obvious to me our classmates feel the same. The problem with electric cars is one that I have been voicing for many years without much impact. Although electric cars themselves do not release emissions, the CO2 emitted from manufacturing as well as the E-waste created by the batteries should be enough for people to consider alternative forms of transportation, however, they are marketed immensely well on the technicality that they are "zero emissions." Additionally, most people do not consider that out of all of the electricity consumed in the united states, only 17% of it comes from renewable resources. Thus, not only is the manufacturing of Tesla so environmentally harmful that they can not be produced in the state of California, but the electricity used to power them is made from BURNING FOSSIL FUELS. Yes, they are more affordable and will reduce your price tag at the pump, but besides that electric cars solve practically nothing.
<br><hr>


Yes, I agree. I was never aware of the manufactured car already released that much of CO2. I do not know the 4.6 tons average car-related CO2 release includes the manufactured process of car or not. However, compared with 2 tons standard, transportation was taken a big portion of the CO2 footprint in people's daily life.
<br><br>


Transportation is necessary, whatever for economic or life quality. Thus, to make transportation more efficient in the environmental aspect and reduce optional transportation are the solution we should do. Public transportation is a good way to efficiently transfer people, but it needs the greater intensity of the population which is hard to achieve in developed nations and will decrease the life quality. The driverless car is another solution. When the driverless car achieves level 5, every car can work 24 hrs, which will impressively reduce the production of the car. The private car become half-public transportation. However, to achieve level 5 still take a long time, after the technology matured, the completed law and environmental also takes time.

I believe I achieved an agreement with what you mentioned in your comment. The U.S. average annual carbon dioxide emissions from cars is 4.6 tons, which is about one-quarter of the annual carbon dioxide emissions per person. It is surprised to know that car makes such a huge impact on global warming. Moreover, it is more surprising to see that about 22 metric tons of CO2 were emitted during the production of a car. Excluding housing, food, clothes, and everything else, we have already reached the top line of emissions we can contribute in a year simply because we buy a car (even without using it). This crazy fact reveals that technological innovation alone cannot achieve the goal of zero emissions. As a result, we should put more attention to the cultural practice of car use. We need to figure out the reason why people are obsessed with cars. I believe there are mainly two reasons. First is about the car itself––Car is now more than just a kind of vehicle. It became a symbol of status. It seems like that if you have an expensive car, you will receive more respect than those people who take public transportation. Another factor is about the public transportation system. Just as you mentioned in your comment, we have to admit that the public transportation system in some places, especially in suburban areas, is slow and unorganized. In some cases, people have no choice but to drive their own cars due to the inconvenience of the public transportation system. So not only individuals but the government should pay much more attention to the construction and improvement of the public transportation system.
<br><hr>

I appreciate the background that Ken provided for the growth of the car industry as well. I think its really interesting to think about the influence the government and corporations had on our lifestyles then and as well as now. When we think of the 1950s post-war, its typical for people to think about a 4 person family living in the suburbs having the newest products, relying on the man to work and the woman to clean. This was the American ideal. Luckily, women started to challenge this ideal, that companies as well as the government created. Consumerism and America's love for cars still perpetuates today, why has this ideal never been challenged? I think part of the reason is what Ken keeps saying, that the affects of climate change have been delayed. No one ever saw it as a bad thing to have a car, it was always painted as a luxury and a status symbol. Of course we know that Americans loves their status symbols. Now that we know more about the environmental impacts of cars, I agree that its time we change this cultural practice as well.  And it's definitely going to take more than technological innovation, as we are starting to see the perpetuation of climate change is caused by major underlying social/cultural problems.

<br><hr>


After watching the lecture video, I totally agree with you said about private cars. I have always been a car lover, and I wished that I could someday have a car of my own. However, what Ken mentioned in the lecture astonished me. According to the recommended individual maximum carbon footprint, the carbon emission caused by producing a single car has already met the standard of a year, 2 metric tons. If you buy a car this year, you must eat and use things that leave not even a bit of carbon footprint in order to meet the recommended standard, not mentioning driving the car and its maintenance, which is apparently impossible. I used to believe that electric cars and hybrid cars are much eco-friendlier that there should be no carbon emission caused by them. However, when companies like Tesla advertising their products, they would never say how much carbon they generated for each car the produce. Instead, they encourage people to buy electric or hybrid cars, allowing people feel innocent, that they are not affecting to the climate at all. This will lead to even more demand of cars then when people feel guilty of buying fossil fuel cars and might cause even high carbon emission. 
<br><br>

Beside the “clever” tactic of car advertising, the cultural sense of value also has a great impact on private car demand. In cities with high population, cars are obviously not a good choice of transportation to work or to school. During rush hours, the time of taking underground transportation to work is nearly the same as driving private car due to traffic jam, or even faster. It also saves money on gas and air conditioning, especially during summer and winter. Despite of this, a great number of people still buy one or even more cars. The reason is that cars are a symbol of enough financial ability and a symbol of freedom, due to the fashion and culture the society exerts on us. When we realize that there is no future for private cars, we should try to change what we value. Someday, if private car owners are perceived as guilty, the carbon footprint of the society will decrease greatly. It doesn’t have to be this extreme, but changes must be made from now on.
<br><hr>

Your analysis of this video is detailed. I agree with you and share the same feeling with you after watching this video. You said the fact that “a manufactured car is already equivalent to releasing two metric tons of CO2” was eye-opening for you. I was astonished, too. The number is so large that we cannot ignore the impact of car emissions. You mentioned that “there is no future in cars when it comes to preventing the climate crisis.” Indeed, if we want to protect our environment from climate crisis, we have to reduce our releasing of carbon dioxide. Since car is one of the big origin of carbon dioxide, we need to reduce our times of using it. I agree with you viewpoint that “both technological advances and cultural changes must be made in order for us to make an impact on the climate crisis.” We need to face the problem and solve it with determination. So we must take actions immediately.


<br><hr>
I was also shocked by the statistic that “a manufactured car is already equivalent to releasing two metric tons of CO2". Ken explains that people should technically only use two metric tons of CO2 per year. It's absurd to me that someone would even purchase a car and not use. While the use of the car makes climate change worse, this video proved to me that it's just ridiculous in general to have a car. My family actually got rid of our two cars three years ago and we share one. While we still are using a large amount of carbon emissions, I now rely on public transportation to get around. Ken remarks the statistic that busses are 14 times more efficient compared to the 25 mile per gallon car in the US. This should be enough incentive for people to switch to using public transportation over automobiles. 
<br><br>
Another thing I find interesting is how easy the public transportation is to navigate. It seems like people keep cars for selfish and materialistic reasons rather than giving them up to help aid the planet.  I was speaking to my cousin who lives in London the other day and he explained to me how he must pay a fee to get into the city during certain hours. I think this is an excellent rule to limit the use of cars in large cities. By charging people, less cars will crowd the city and spread CO2 emissions. Another surprising fact that this video presented was that even electric cars are bad for the environment. People, especially in cities like Los Angeles, are so thrilled to show off their Tesla's as if they don't harm the planet. It's disappointing to learn how even these cars are still bad. However, I am happy to know that there is a solution in site: to switch to trains, metros, carpooling, and busses. I believe that by branding busses and trains in a cool way, people could be swayed to ditch their cars. My family is first hand proof.
<br><hr>

I completely agree- the statistics mentioned in this lecture were really shocking. I never considered the amount of pollution the production of cars makes, and considering the assumption that there will probably be 2 billion cars in the world soon, I can only imagine how much pollution that will put into the air. I was also surprised about the fact that electric cars aren't a very good solution- but they have to be manufactured as well, so it only makes sense. 
<br><br>
I'm from the bay, so public transportation is nothing  too crazy or new to me. It's efficient, it's way cheaper than having a car/paying for gas and parking,  and it gets a lot of people where they need to go, keeping them off the roads in cars or other vehicles. Though it's not a perfect system, I think public transport like BART and subways is definently the right way to go- I just fear how much resistance there is against implementing them. We've all heard talks about the bullet trains that would go all the way down California, connect NYC and LA and go all over the country, making driving and flying a lot less desirealbe. However, there is so much push back about it because of how much it would cost to build and how long it would take to build. I feel that is hypocritical because I'm sure that there was that same push back with building all the highways across the states that Ken talked about in the lecture- but we built them and look how much they are being used! then, Imagine how much we would use public transportation if it was as readily accessible as highways are in the US. I think implementing more bus systems in suburbs as well as increasing monorail/subway/rail transpirtation in cities will really cut down on vehicle usage/purchasing, we just have to start making it accessible.
<br><hr>
I was also extremely astonished when I found out that just the manufacturing process of creating a car releases two metric tons of CO2. THAT IS JUST FOR ONE CAR. Isn't that just crazy to take in? So far everything that I have learned from all the readings, films, and lecture videos have have been very eye opening but the statistics that Ken provided us in this video just left me even more shocked. I honestly thought Elon Musk was onto something when he created Tesla. Don't get me wrong, we all know that driving an electric car is still better off than driving a regular one but after hearing all the statistics makes me not want to drive or even own a car at all. As a kid I was too consumed in the cultural problem with thinking that having a car is much cooler than taking public transportation. I would look at fancy cars and think “wow I can't wait until I own one of those when im older,” but now that I understand the environmental damage of owning a car does, I rather not. In highschool when I owned my first car, boy was I extremely happy! I drove that thing everywhere without realizing the damage I was causing. Now that I live here in Santa Barbara I do not own a car nor plan on owning one anytime soon. I constantly use public transportation when needed and this turnaround was not difficult at all, anyone can do it, so why don't they? It all goes back to this being a cultural problem as Ken mentioned, but I am not so sure how quick society will adapt to this and change their ways.

<br><hr>
I agree, I had no idea the extent to which producing one car alone had on our carbon footprint. Knowing that most people in the United States have already exceeded a sustainable carbon footprint just by buying a car is absolutely insane considering all the other aspects of their lifestyle that contribute to their carbon footprint and have not been accounted for. While I do support a transition to electric cars, Ken makes it clear that this simply wont be enough to offset major emissions caused by transportation. Instead it is crucial we make a transition to public transportation and address any caveats in this transition. For example, many cities public transportation simply is not well developed enough to serve its population and need to be further developed in order to meet the needs of where people need to go within a reasonable amount of time. Additionally, perhaps the greatest contributors of automobile emissions live in suburbs so these people would need to make a transition to live closer to the cities in order to have access to public transportation. While this may seem unrealistic, it is necessary if any emissions want to be cut in this sector.

<br><br>
  I also agree with you in the fact that aside from technological developments there is a greater need for a cultural shift. I found it unsettling that more cars existed than licensed drivers in the United States. While this alone is unnecessary, it goes to show the demand our culture has created in the automobile sector. Moreover, advertisements and commercials have implanted the idea into the minds of millions Americans that owning a car is an essential need. Why do we not yet have commercials advertising public transportation or the train that can take you cross country? Americans watch TV and think “Yes I need that new car” but how do we shift that thinking into “I’d prefer to take the bus”?

<br><hr>
Dude I already commented my real comment but just wanted to say this was so well written the stats are crazy. You are clearly super passionate about climate change.

<br><hr>

While I am not the kind of person that is super into cars and is always looking to buy the most flashy car, I did grow up with cars as a part of my lifestyle. My family always had 2 cars, one for my dad and one for my mom so they could go to work. We live in a suburb, so driving is a must as the public transportation in our area is very infrequent (long waits between buses) and they did not go to most of the places we needed to go and would require transferring to a different bus system (taking more than an hour to get somewhere that with a car would take 15 minutes). I always saw cars as a given for the present and also in my future, although I planned to get an electric, zero-emissions car when I eventually would get one. However, learning that electric cars emit even more than regular cars during their production has become a deterrent for buying a car. Like you, I was surprised that although they don't emit much during driving, the production cost is still a big factor.
<br><br>

Unfortunately, as Ken said, the funding for public transportation is much less than it could have been. I agree that changing our culture, moving away from cars and towards public transportation needs to happen to make any kind of difference. Cars make up a quarter of our emissions, and by cutting them out, we would be taking a huge step forward.

Thank you for your thoughts, I think you raised some good points! I do think that it is important to place a greater emphasis on public transportation and encourage more people to utilize it as their main source of transportation rather than individual car use. However, I agree with you in the sense that there needs to be more improvement in public transportation because as we all know, it can be somewhat of an annoyance to use it. I found it interesting in the lecture that Professor Ken mentioned car manufacturers have been working hand in hand with politicians to ensure people’s reliance on the automobile industry and as a result, public transportation has received dramatically less federal funding. Once again, we are able to see how corrupt politics coupled with economic personal interest can lead to the hindrance of climate change reform. If we really want to change the car culture of today’s society, we have to see more funds and attention being put towards public transportation and the accessibility of it. 
<br><br>


Another point I would like to talk about is how Professor Ken suggests that we have to do more than buy electric cars to help the issue at hand and that if we are serious about reducing our carbon footprint, we have to change our cultural practices. Admittedly, I was very shocked like so many of our peers about the number of metric tons it takes to produce an ironically “zero-emission” car. However, I am skeptical of whether or not we can just effectively steer away from car use in general. The automobile provides mobility that is very convenient for humans. Whether it is for work or school, driving a car may be someone’s lone form of transportation. Because of distance, it may not be possible for one to ride their bike or walk, and because of the limiting mobility of public transportation, sometimes a car is more convenient. Realistically, I do not see our society’s use of the car changing as drastically as professor Ken envisions, but I do think that we should all be mindful of the alternative modes of transportation when they are available. I also do believe that zero-emission cars are still a lot more environmentally friendly than regular ones and that their use should not be overly downplayed. 

<br><br>

However, I do think that a change does need to take place in the way in which we use our cars. Seeing that public transportation is significantly more fuel-efficient, we need to extend the routes into suburban areas, not just in big metropolitan ones. Coming from a suburban town in the bay area, the main form of public transportation is the Bart system. However, because Bart does not reach many of the areas in the bay area, I am sometimes forced to use my car because there is no way for me to get to my destination otherwise. With problems such as these, people are discouraged from using public transportation, and I now know why this area lacks the federal funds to expand. Even here at UCSB, I hear of people taking their car to go to class. I feel as though this is entirely unnecessary because of the biking community that is so prevalent on campus and is just downright lazy. Small things such as this can go a long way in reducing our carbon footprint, but again, it all comes down to us making the conscious effort to be more mindful of our actions.
<br><hr>


I completely agree with your statement about feeling so naive about not taking into consideration how the manufacturing process of electric cars impacts our carbon footprint tremendously, because I felt the exact same way. I always thought that electric cars, such as Tesla, were this new innovation that produced zero emissions and would change our world for the better. Little did I know that the process to produce such an innovation would result in surpassing our annual limit for carbon emissions for the year before we had even purchased the car. This is not taking into account, as you said, “housing, food, and everything else”. I also agree with your claim that our current transportation system in the U.S is chaotic and extremely dangerous. Other non-public, transportational vehicles in general are dangerous in themselves, taking into account that over 50 million people are killed or injured in traffic accidents worldwide, as stated by Hiltner. It’s even considered to be an epidemic. You’re right about the fact that we should all transition to public transportation, because it’s just plain logic. The benefits greatly outweigh the detriments. The only detriment, as implied by the media, being that it’s not cool to do so. 
 <br><br>

I wanted to mention how you brought up that you knew people who love spending money on their cars, customizing them, and maintaining them, etc. Even though it’s a little off topic from the lecture video, I feel like what you said also connects to one of our other assignments, the documentary about minimalism. As many people do, they try to make their car look the best, and for what? I feel like people just try to get validation from others, others whom most often don’t even care or like them. Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure there’s many people out there that genuinely love and value their cars solely because it makes them happy, and that’s fine, but for those that are just trying to impress, I ponder the question: “Is it really worth it?”. Onto the topic of cultural changes, as you mentioned, I believe that cultural changes are the key to truly stopping the climate crisis to a halt. Technological advancements can only do so much without us putting in any sort of beneficial, cultural change. With these two combined, and utilized to their maximum ability, not only can we reduce the impacts of climate change, but I truly believe that we can change the world for the betterment of our future.


<br><hr>
I agree with a number of things that you have mentioned in your comment. I too found the history behind our cultural fascination of cars to be intriguing. It really goes to show how cars have been a long running issue to this country. It also astounded me how the manufacturing of the car itself is already 2 metric tons of our carbon footprint. After watching Ken’s lecture, it is clear to me that cars are a luxury we cannot afford (both environmentally and financially). Before, I also considered zero-emission cars as a backup option, since cars are such a prevalent resource in much of my life. However, after watching this lecture, this is clearly not an option and while it does dishearten me a little, I know it is something that we must give up. We only have one earth and we need to do our best to protect it. 
 <br><br>
Now turning to the idea of public transportation, I think it is a brilliant solution. However, as you mentioned, the public transportation sector of our country is disorganized and inconvenient. I disagree with Ken in the idea that people do not take public transportation because it is not “cool”, but rather believe that it is because it is so inconvenient for people to use that they often just opt for the car. I think action needs to be taken in this sector for the better of our planet. There should be work done to potentially boost the convenience of our public transportation system. Disregarding suburbs, even the public transportation of big cities are inadequate. In Los Angeles, for example, so many people use cars and create so much traffic because the public transportation system is almost non existent. I think this is one of the biggest issues that need to be tackled in order to solve the climate crisis.


<br><hr>

thank you for sharing and I totally agree with your comment! I think that technology can be a really effective tool in assisting us to help alleviate the climate crisis, but ultimately it will not be the solution to this issue. We cannot just depend upon technology and cross our fingers hoping that it will magically make the climate crisis disappear without taking any actions on our behalf; it is simply impossible. Incorporating technology in our plan solving the climate crisis is a good start, but more practical and drastic actions need to be taken if we want to see any actual results and if we really want to save our planet. I also agree that changing our cultural habits and practices, such as our over-reliance on automobiles in our daily lives, is crucial to solving the climate crisis and to preserve our environment. If a sweeping transformation or change in our traditional cultural practices and beliefs does not occur, then all the positive changes, if there is any, that we have already implemented will eventually be meaningless and will go to waste as we will continue our old habits and ways of living that everything will go back to its original state and before we have done any actions to protect our environment. In order for the issue of the climate crisis to be truly solved and for our actions to have real long-lasting impacts and significance on our environment, we need to recognize how environmental-costly our cultural practices and beliefs are, we need to see how the societal trends such as owning and driving a car, are boosting our pride while sacrificing our precious environment, and only then we can be truly motivated to abandon those cultural practices and beliefs to adopt more environmental-friendly habits and practices in an effort to save our environment.

<br><hr>

I felt the exact same when watching this video. It's absolutely insane to think that merely owning a car uses up our allotment of 2 tons of CO2 per year. While I was for the most part aware that cars were having detrimental effects on the environment, I was definitely not aware of how much public transportation could reduce our carbon footprint. While public transportation is not always the most convenient or time efficient, it IS much cheaper and much healthier for our planet. So I completely agree with Professor Hiltner in the crucial importance of "rewriting a range of cultural practices" and not just developing new technology. People have to change the way they think, act, and live, instead of just waiting for the next technological "solution" to come out. Like Ken said, this is a human issue and can be greatly improved by human efforts.

<br><hr>

I, too, was shocked to hear that manufacturing a car would emit that much CO2. I was so naive to think that a "zero emission" vehicle was truly free of emissions, as I had completely pushed aside the effects of actually producing the car itself. I used to put Tesla and Prius on a pedestal because I just thought that these cars were the ultimate way to be environmentally-friendly and reduce your carbon footprint. Even though it is much better than gasoline-emitting vehicles, it is not the final solution. I'm not sure if there will ever be a final solution if I'm being honest. Owning a car, especially a nice one, is definitely a classist dilemma. People will always turn and look at Ferraris and Lamborghinis and think, "Wow, that's a nice car!" Even when cars rev their engines down the streets of Isla Vista, everyone stops and turns their head. We, as Americans, think that just because something has a hefty price tag, it is something desirable and should be sought after. 

 <br><br>

Along with a desire for cars in regards of status, it simply is the fastest mode of transportation in America (other than planes of course). The public transportation system here simply sucks. I remember taking a bus to downtown Santa Barbara (State Street) my freshman year, and it took fifty minutes. So many Americans value their time, since it is finite resource, and cars are an easy solution. Instead of taking public transportation for nearly an hour, a person can get there in fifteen minutes with a car. Furthermore, taking a train to Los Angeles from Santa Barbara can take three hours, while driving a car there can get you there in an hour and forty five minutes. The convenience of cars just cannot be beat by our system of public transportation. If California improved their buses and trains, maybe these modes of transportation would be more appealing. However, I think that for now, driving an electric car is the best way to combat CO2 emissions, until we come up with a way to either fix our public transportation or manufacture vehicles with fewer emissions.



<br><hr>
While I certainly agree with you, and am also shocked at the car carbon emission statistics too, I think we need to still have hope in cars like Teslas still. We are a world that relies on cars and transportation and we aren’t yet a world that sees the true value of public transportation. Honestly I’m not too sure we ever will. And this is why we need to shift the focus of the issue off of the cars and onto the advertising shinannigans that cause the manufacturing of such a large number of cars. Our world is all about supply and demand and if we reduce the demand for cars then in turn, obviously, we reduce the supply. Like Ken said in the video “engineering a huge vehicle for one person will never be environmentally conscious.” 
 <br><br>

The car business thrives because cars are seen as cool and a sign of property and wealth. This is where I think we need to shift the focus. I think we need to invest money into making public transport a nicer experience. While maintaining this transport and keeping it clean and nice would be expensive and would be timely, a lot more people would use the public transportation this way. And right now, more use of public transportation seems to be really what we need based on what Ken said about how switching our transportation habits to using busses, our carbon footprint would be reduced by a factor of 14! That is a huge number and it is the kind of change that we really need to be seeing as a society. And on top of this, only 5% of the population uses busses to commute. Making public transportation a clean, accessible, and popular mode of transport is our next step.

<br><hr>
I agree with your point about public transportation. However, a key issue with that is that public transportation has this negative connotation. “Many people believe that technological innovation is the solution to the climate crisis, … we need to face the fact that cultural changes are every bit if not more important.” This quote begins Ken’s lecture on the climate crisis as a cultural problem. I agree with what certain parts of what Ken says about the climate crisis being a cultural problem. However, while I agree with Ken that technology will not be sufficient, I find it hard to believe that people will simply agree to change their perspective, and do what is beneficial to our environment. Call me a pessimist, but I don’t see the necessary changes happening any time soon. Buses, trains and subways are far more gasoline efficient than a car, but I don’t see people simply giving up the perceived freedom and luxuries that a car grants. 
 <br><br>

I found Ken’s breakdown of how our nationwide car culture came about to be interesting. I hadn’t known that the immediate aftermath of World War 2 is what brought us to our current car culture. To rewrite cultural practices on a level this big is a monumental task. I do not see a cultural shift taking place without significant government support of public/mass transit. Our mass transit infrastructure is extremely lacking compared to countries like Japan or Korea. We need to modernize our mass transit infrastructure, as well as make it cheaper. Take BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) for example, it costs me almost 16$ to go to SF and back from my East Bay hometown. I hope the new (or even current) administration will tackle this issue from 2020 forth.

<br><hr>

It is sort of mind blowing to know that even the amount of carbon dioxide emitted during the production of an automobile would reach reach the maximal carbon footprint for a single person. It really sets an alarm for our overuse of vehicles instead of taking public transit. The history of how the American culture was obsessed with cars was also eye opening. It is unbelievable to see how enterprises and the government successfully convinced the public that spending a significant amount of our salaries to own a car and risking our life in driving it would be cool rather than taking a bus or biking. Admittedly, cars could be useful under certain situations, the overall cost is pretty high, much higher than what the planned can afford. However, I still believe that technological advances would be significant in our fight against the climate change in addition to the humanity and social science perspectives. We cannot rely on one of them and abandon the other. We must approach our future from both sides to eventually clear our way out.
<br><hr>

Yeah, it was very surprising that just the fact of having bought a car without even driving it a person already exceeds the amount of CO2 emission they should produce. So even if people do things like carpooling and buy electric cars , although they do less damage they still contribute to the problem, so like Ken mentioned society needs to rethink the idea of having automobiles in the first place rather than trying to go around the fact that cars are the problem and say lets just try to make a better more environment friendly car. I think in order to seriously do something about the climate crisis people need to be willing to make compromises in their daily lives for the longterm benefit of the planet and sake of future generations.
<br><hr>

I was aware that cars were not good for the environment, but I was certainly not aware to the great extent that cars are damaging our environment. By simply owning a car, without even driving it, we've already reached the maximum amount of carbon emissions that one should contribute over a course of many years.  I agree with your statement about how a climate-friendly future will be absent of cars. I think about the many movies that I've seen where filmmakers have depicted a futuristic scene with crazy architecture, strange clothing, and, of course, super advanced cars- cars that can fly, drive through water, etc. Our culture has always had an infatuation with cars and it will certainly be no easy task to get rid of these beloved technological creations.  Unfortunately, I'm pessimistic that change will occur. With the increasing popularity and growth of electric cars, people believe they are making a positive impact on the planet by purchasing a "zero-emission" vehicle. There is a lot of hope in technology and I think that people expect that new inventions and discoveries will allow them to continue to whip around cars and live in spacious homes. Additionally, with the current public transportation system in America, cars are just easier and quicker to get around. In short, getting rid of the car culture will be incredibly difficult, though it is entirely necessary for the sake of the planet.

<br><hr>
Your comment is amazing! Before watching this video, I thought exactly the same as you that Tesla is a zero-emission brand. However, the video says that the manufacturing process of Tesla produces more CO2 than that of others, somewhere between 15 to 68 percent more, which is unbelievable to me.

 <br><br>


I think the major reason why people prefer a car instead of public transportation is that they will feel more freely when driving a car. As buses are impossible to take you anywhere you want to go, a car can do a better job in this circumstance. Sometimes people need to walk to the next bus or subway stop, and they still have to wait for those public transportations. At night when public transportations are no longer in service, cars play an important rule when someone has to go somewhere.
<br><hr>
You are right.Technological advances can only take us so far. The most ground-breaking and effective change will come from cultural revolutions. We must not only change the way we commute but change the way we live in general. Instead of opting to take a 3 minute drive down the street to the nearest grocery store, we could take a 15 minute walk. Decreasing our reliance on cars would be such a liberating experience in general. We would no longer have to worry about car accidents, car problems, and gas. It's sad how reliant so many of us are  reliant on cars. I wish Santa Barbara or even my hometown of Los Angeles had a better system for public transportation. It could honestly solve so many of the commuting problems that Los Angeles is known for. Not only would this make commuting to work and school so much faster but it would alleviate our reliance on cars and significantly decrease traffic problems in the area.
 <br><br>

I also found it so incredibly eye opening to see how much Carbon the manufacturing of a car produces. I too had thought that electric cars were a modern solution to our modern problems. Now, I am aware of how damaging it is to our environment to buy a car. Ken was 100% correct when he said that our solutions to these problems must come from cultural changes. Like he said in the first lecture, Climate Change is a human change and must be approached from a humanities point of view. Now, I couldn't agree more.

<br><hr>


I totally agree on the technological advances won’t solve the climate crisis. You know we have a tendency to gravitate to these technocratic plans to solve things like the climate crisis. And I don’t know if it’s due to a lack of information on the climate crisis or selfishness. These plans don’t really tackle the root cause of the climate crisis but instead goes after the low hanging fruit. It quite honestly a waste of time and a disservice to humanity to focus all of our attention on things like technology to fix our problems. And while I applaud Mr. Musk on his efforts to help the planet by being innovative in electric cars, one man cannot solve the problem. There’s no ones savior that can help us. We need to help ourselves by  fundamental changing our all consuming lifestyles.
<br><hr>
On your comment about the current public transportation system in America, I would have to totally agree. Even if I wanted to take public transportation around my city, I would not even know how to go about it. I am almost certain there are no bus stops within any close distance from my house. I couldn't even bike to a bus stop because the closest one that I know of is at least 7 miles away. For me, it just doesn't make any logical sense to take public transportation around my town. And that's where I believe the main issue is:
 <br><br>

A lot of our suburbs were built around the idea of cars.
 <br><br>

In order to have more and more people to adopt public transportation as their main method of transportation, there needs to be a revamp across the country. Yes, a lot of people could already make the transition to public transportation if they live in an urban area, but for the 175 million people who live in suburbs, it most likely would be a difficult transition. If public transportation becomes more advertised and more viable for people in these suburbs, then our environmental impact would be bound to lower.

<br><hr>

I can relate to this comment wholeheartedly. The discussion of this lecture was very eye-opening to me. For one thing, I too thought Teslas and electric cars were more eco-friendly and thought the future would include more of them to help the environment. It is sad that in reality, CO2 is emitted just from manufacturing it. A manufactured car is already equivalent to releasing two metric tons of CO2 which is only post-production and the yearly average we should release in total to keep the planet healthy. That is insane to me! I thought changing technology and advancing it to be more environmentally conscious was a strong way to combat the climate crisis, but I did not consider the impact towards the environment that would be made to even reach this. I would think back to the global footprint of previous generations made to make their lives more convenient, but disregarded how technology fails to save us now. Electric cars do make a difference, but not significantly enough to save us. It truly is differences in our lifestyle that can make the difference because even continuing to try to invent technology to save us will continue our downfall.
 <br><br>

Car culture relates to the American Dream and is flexible with working on your own schedule and showing all that you worked for. But there are other resources in life that can allow us to let this go. An Average American works one day per week to afford a car and though this suggests freedom, Ken says it perfectly that true freedom can be found in another way. Imagine instead of spending nine thousand dollars a year for car expenses, put that in your retirement fund from when you start entering the workplace in early 20s so you could retire at late 40s rather than mid-60s. The freedom of not having that extra day of work go towards your car -- it connects back to the film and reading for minimalism and simplification. Happiness can be found this way, having the money for experiences to make you happy and using funds for what you need and want.
 <br><br>

I know it is not easy to convert and this is because our current public transportation system does not accommodate to what we need. As you said it yourself, our public transportation can be dreadful. It’s slow, unorganized, chaotic, and potentially dangerous. Even taking the bus from Santa Catalina to UCSB is unreliable. People will cut, buses won’t be on time, there won’t be enough room on the bus, etc. We really need support to initiate this movement. We need attention towards improving this transportation system. We need a greater emphasis on biking and walking with the bike lanes,  bike paths, and sidewalks to ensure it can be done safely and legally. This requires local and above authority’s attention as well as allocated funds. And this is just for transportation! If we don’t utilize funds to assist these intense changes to our culture and day to day lives, then we will end up wasting our money away to salvage the consequences of the climate crisis.



<br><hr>

I agree with your idea. It is pretty much the same as mine. I previously thought tesla is the best choice for our current society, but after I watching this video, I was totally wrong. Did not take the huge manufacturing process into consideration.
<br><hr>


I was also amazed by the fact that buying a car produces a large amount of CO2 without even driving it. Since moving to UCSB I have utilized public transportation significantly more than I had previous to college. Back at home, I prided myself on owning a Prius, believing that I was making an impact by driving a hybrid car; yet, I now realize that the only impact I was making was one that was detrimental to our environment. Having a car can be a lot more convenient since you can leave to your destination at any time and not have a plan, whereas taking public transportation takes a little longer and takes a little planning. Yet, the benefits surpass the consequences in terms of helping the environment. As a society, we need to culturally shift into the more eco-friendly modes of transportation and ditch the destructive car culture. I think it’s important that this knowledge of carbon emissions, especially the fact that “zero-emission” cars cause harm, is spread to the public. Knowledge is power and we must educate our society in order to make an eco-friendly cultural shift and to make public transportation something regarded as “cool”.
 <br><br>

I believe that technological improvements and innovations should continue to be made in the transportation sector, but should shift to focusing on public transportation. Santa Barbara MTD has made a goal of having its entire fleet consist of zero-emission buses by 2030. I’m proud to be living in such a progressive city and I have hope that other cities could adopt the same goal and make a drastic difference.

<br><hr>


I agree with so many of the points you made in your comment. I too viewed Tesla as the future of transportation and considered it to be the solution to the transportation emissions issue before watching this video. Along with that I had never considered that the manufacturing process of making "zero-emission" vehicles actually emits so much CO2 that buying a "zero-emissions" vehicle is basically pointless. I agree that it can be disheartening to realize that all of these new and more "eco-friendly" innovations are still very damaging to the environment. What is most discouraging to me is that so many people still view Teslas and other "green" cars as the solution because that is how they are advertised to the public! I think if people realized that the process of making these cars is as harmful to the environment as buying a regular car anyways, they would definitely not be as popular and people may consider other transportation alternatives such as the bus or a bike. 
 <br><br>
I think Ken makes a great point that science and technology can only bring us so far in combating climate change and that what we really need right now is a shift in culture and societal values. Sure, people can try to invent a car and a way to make cars that emits no CO2, that'd be cool. But what would really affect the amount of CO2 emitted by each person would be if they ceased to depend on cars altogether. Riding your bike or walking emits absolutely no CO2 and is great exercise! Unfortunately, as Ken stated, because of our current culture, these alternatives are looked down upon and viewed as "drab". As someone who used to think riding a bike was uncool and now depends on a bike to get everywhere everyday, I know that it is possible to change people's mentalities regarding this type of thing and I have hope that people will realize that being green is not only cool but good for you too!
<br><hr>

I completely agree with you. I believe the biggest problem with electric cars is that they are labeled as “zero emission” or “clean air” vehicles. While on the surface they may appear to be that way since they do not directly give off emissions, this however is still a misnomer since all of their emissions are indirect. I have always known that “zero emissions” for cars has never really been true since all electric cars need will need to plug into a power source to recharge. A source that more likely than not generates its power from fossil fuels. I never knew however, that just the construction of an electric car was so great. Finding out that just buying an electric car, not even driving, would mean that you generated the maximum amount of emissions that you should do for the next 11 years. Maybe instead of trying to create the perfect “zero emission” car, they should work on making public transportation more appealing as Ken stated.


<br><hr>



I completely agree. Tech innovations will not be the solution to the climate crisis. Unfortunately, I think that many people are waiting to act because they are holding out for the suspected inventions. As a society, we need to shift this view into urging people to act now. A shift in our cultural practices would benefit the earth far more than if people bought new electric cars. If we want to halt the climate crisis, I agree that there is no future in cars. 
 <br><br>

I also agree that there is a stigma in many suburban places about using public transportation. I visit the midwest in the summer, and I have realized that I have never once seen a public bus. This shows how much room we have for improvement in the sector of public transportation across America, but also highlights how alien the urged change may be to some. I and many others would benefit greatly from a bus where I go for the summer, and I realize how sad it is that there is not one already. People as a whole need to push for reliable and available public transportation across the globe. I think that for more people to accept this change, we should reinvent our current public transportation to make it more appealing for all. Many believe it is dirty and not worth the hassle, but this stigma must change. 
 <br><br>

I wish the world hadn't gotten so engrossed in automobiles in the first place. It has sadly become something that many people even base their personalities off of. However, now that we are where we are today, we must shift our lifestyle surrounding them in order to help the planet. To tackle the climate crisis, we must change our cultural view of cars.

<br><hr>

It is very unfortunate that in most of the US, having a car is more convenient and more preferable to using public transportation.  Switching from using cars to using public transportation would greatly reduce the amount of CO2 emissions, but because everyone prefers to travel by car, it is unlikely that we will make that switch quickly just because we are told that it damages the environment.  Also, because it is so common to travel everywhere by car, the idea of switching to public transportation will not become popular quickly enough to save the planet.  
 <br><br>
I grew up thinking that all adults need a car, and had never considered not having one as an adult.  I did not see why I would use public transportation if I could just have a car that I can use whenever I want.  
 <br><br>
I was not aware of the impact cars were making on our carbon footprint.  While I did know that cars were contributing to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, I never looked up how much of the carbon emissions came from cars.  It was a shock to hear that so much of our carbon footprint was just from our cars.  I think that most people do not consider their carbon footprint when they purchase a car.  They just think about how convenient having a car is.  
 <br><br>
While the idea of using public transportation and not owning a car might seem inconvenient now, it is possible that eventually we will switch to depending on public transportation because of the lifestyle preferences of the younger generation.  People of the younger generation would rather live in apartments in cities than in the suburban areas because it would be cheaper and closer to where they work.  This means that as living in cities becomes more popular, public transportation systems will be used more often because traveling by car would be inconvenient as there is such a high concentration of people.
<br><hr>

The statistic that I found astonishing was how the average American works a day/week just to afford their car. Imagine 15% of one's income to be dependent on a single device that is not even necessary to live. Despite all the culture supporting the use of cars, I really do not see the practical use in utilizing them, especially considering how many problems they will potentially cause in the long-run. Another thing to take in consideration was the fact that a passenger train is 30x more efficient than your average car. I believe that the idea that this problem can be fixed through technological innovation just reinforces people's bad habits, and as a result, no work is done towards the actual solution. This isn't, of course, to say that the technology is bad or not needed in this crisis. I believe we need all the help we can get to contribute to fewer emissions. It is a bit reassuring to realize that, by living on campus and biking to school everyday, I am significantly reducing my transmissions compared to if I made the commute. Doing this for the past couple months has made me realize that not using a car is an option (no matter how many times I fail to understand how the bus system works). Hopefully, I can rely on my future self to continue on this trend for the upcoming years instead of falling into the consumerism trap that is the car industry.

<br><hr>
When I saw this part of the title of this video “why electric cars are more trouble than good”, the first car that came to mind were Teslas, and I became a bit confused because I too thought Tesla to be a zero-emissions car. All this time I’ve been assuming that these cars are helping reduce the CO2 emissions, which they are while on the road, but not when being manufactured. I mean two metric tons of CO2 are emitted for just a single car to be made, that’s the maximum amount we should be contributing in a year, but by driving the car and doing other things among that, we greatly surpass that bar. It just blows my mind and I now realize I need to look more into these things because not everything is what it seems. I hope that we can get to the point in time when we all collectively help the environment by commuting instead of driving everywhere. So we need to spread the word that not just driving car is damaging the environment, but also the making of them, because I’m pretty sure there are tons of people out there who believe that because they dive electric cars they’re “saving” the environment and they don’t know the half of it.
<br><hr>

I have the same feeling too. Before I watch this lecture, I had never thought about that even if we don’t use the car and park in the garage, the car itself has already released two metric tons of CO2 during the manufacturing process. And if we want to reduce 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius, we have to emit no more than two metric tons of CO2. In order to achieve this goal, we need to decrease the quantity of purchasing cars. However, because of culture, cars symbolize freedom to Americans so they can drive around everywhere. Therefore, it causes one American person to own more than one car. I think this problem also exists in many countries. I am glad that my country China has done something to control the number of cars in this respect. The government issues the limited car plates for people every year so that there are only a certain amount of cars can be purchased. Also, I am very proud that my country has one of the most advanced public transit systems. People can go anywhere by train or bus in a short amount of time without driving cars. Those are great methods to reduce our carbon footprint that worth learning all over the world. 
 <br><br>
For electric cars, people first think of zero-emissions because they don’t use gas. Leaving aside the fact that two metric tons of CO2 released during the manufacturing process. Have we ever think of where does electricity comes from. Actually, using wind or water power to generate electricity is a very small amount. In America, the most common way to generate electricity is by burning coral or fossil fuel. Those power plants emit tons of CO2 every year. So this is a false idea.

Hi Jay, I was also surprised by the fact that “a manufactured car is already equivalent to releasing two metric tons of CO2.” Before watching this video, I thought if we drive less or share rides with others, we can reduce our carbon footprints, but I didn’t realize that only buying the car means we already reached the maximum amount of CO2 emissions individual can contribute to keeping the global temperature rise under two degrees Celsius. Buying and maintaining a car cost around 9,000 dollars per year which is a larger portion of family income, and as we all know, traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for young people. If instead of spending 9,000 dollars a year to own a car and put that money in your retirement account when you first start to enter the workplace. If you did this, you could retire 20 years earlier and use this time to do whatever you want. So, why are people still so obsessed with driving cars? Professor Hiltner provides some reasons. In the US culture, cars are cool. After WWII, the post-war US automobile industry depended on convincing the public the cars were cool and got people to buy cars to keep the economy going. Besides, I think people are obsessed with buying cars because this is a good way to show others that they are rich or they have a good life.
 <br><br>
I also agree with you that technology alone will not help us tackle the climate crisis. Taking cars as an example, electric cars don’t reduce the CO2 emission to the point where we expect, so in order to achieve our goal, we need to change our lifestyles. As Professor Hilner said, we may help foster a culture in which riding a bus or train is more appealing than traveling by car. Technological innovations can help us tackle the climate crisis or make it worse; it depends on us how to use the innovations.

<br><hr>

I agree with you that technology will not save us from the climate crisis, as Ken also emphasized. Along with cars, technology like solar panels and wind turbines will emit CO2 in their production, especially if they’re created in abundance. In reality, we are only going to be able to use technology  for the better if we all start making radical changes into our lives. The production of technology will only hinder us if we wait until last minute. This lecture opened my eyes to the fact that there is no future for cars leading up to the next couple decades. This seems hard to imagine, especially in a world where we pride ourselves in what were driving. It was astonishing to hear that placing all the car end to end would result in the cars circling the planet around 31 times. We’ve all heard this regarding water bottles, but its a lot crazier hearing it with cars. In smaller, more compact cities, it will be easier to transition toward public transit. However, the suburbs will be a much more difficult transition. I don’t own a car myself, but my sister does, and that is what we use to drive back home every couple of weeks. After watching this lecture, it really made me think about our own carbon footprints and how were adding to the climate crisis. Sometimes we think about our climate crisis as an “us” problem. We talk about the United States and how were a leading emitter and its so easy to just say, “ Well, I’m not eating meat” or “I don’t live in a mansion” so that doesn’t  apply to me. But take a step back and look at your own carbon footprint from an individual perspective and see how much more you could be doing. Unfortunately ,not everyone is doing their part to stop the climate crisis, so its critical that those of us who are, are trying to do everything we can in our own lives.

The statistic really was eye-opening, literally no driving it just manufacturing it, there's no point in getting it. Like you I really thought the use of electric cars would be better than a normal car but it is just the same thing as buying a regular car, if it isn’t in the manufacturing then it is in the driving where they come out to being the same thing. I know a lot of people who are like that too, they spend so much on their vehicles and can also personally relate. My brother is one of those people, he used to be obsessed with fixing his car, now he is obsessed with leasing the latest car. Before watching this I can include myself in the culture that's obsessed with having a car. Honestly I have recently been using public transportation a lot but I wouldn’t like it because some people are weird and it takes longer to get places. They don’t leave you where you need to be and yes it's cheaper, saves more CO2 emissions but it was a hassle. After this video I feel a little guilty for wanting a car and I don’t want to create any more greenhouse gasses than needed per person. However like said I feel like having public transportation be more normal and actually improving the transportation we can have more people accept it and use it. 
 <br><br>
Agreed, we really have to change our cultural practices to be able to do something about climate change. Actions are what we need to tackle climate change.
<br><hr>

I agree with opinion on the impact that cars have to our climate. I was also surprised when it a manufactured car is equivalent to releasing two metric tons of CO2, right off the bat. A person should only emit two metric tons of CO2 a year as well. The fact that even trying to make environmentally-friendly cars doesn't do much into helping the environment leaves us only one option which is what Ken mentioned to be that we need to change the culture of cars. If we strictly only allow ourselves to use public transportation like buses, trains, subways, etc., we can emit less CO2. While this seems like an impractical situation, I do believe that if everyone starts believing in climate change, and our world leaders take into consideration of this change, we can ultimately save our planet.
<br><hr>
The current public transportation situation is awful, and that’s why I believe so many people are favoring cars despite the immense carbon footprint. Last year, my boyfriend came up from Irvine to visit by rideshare, and he could not find a ride back. I looked up different public transportations and bought him a greyhound ticket. He waited almost more than two hours at the bus station before a worker told him he would already miss his connecting bus. My boyfriend ended up having to miss class and take the Amtrak the following day. I made sure there was no connecting trains and worried if it was actually going to come or not. I would love to take public transportation, but in the end, it’s very unreliable. Not only is public transportation disorganized, but they also take a much longer period of time to get places. From Goleta to Irvine, it would usually take around two and a half hours, but the Amtrak takes around four hours, almost double in time. In order to ensure being places on time, many people will opt to take their own vehicle, in which I hope they participate in rideshare. 
 <br><br>
Therefore, if electric cars are not the solution to reducing our carbon footprint, then something about public transportation must change in order to sway people into doing so. It’s not whether public transportation is cool or not, but in my opinion, it’s mostly about the efficiency. My friend from SJSU says he has to wake up three hours before class in order to get a parking spot, and I asked him why he doesn’t take the bus. He responded that sometimes it does not show up and doesn’t want to miss class. Public transportation needs to get rid of the stigma of being undependable and disadvantages by actually taking action of being the opposite. Although I know that must be difficult with the budget, I also think it’s necessary in order for people to actually use it. I was also shocked about the statistic, and the fact that having a car and not using it can still leave such a large carbon footprint. I never really thought about how the American culture jump started the luxurious idea of cars. In my own life, I know many people who put a lot of money into making their cars “cool.” I do agree that we must change certain aspects of our lives in response to climate change, but I hope it won’t be for the lesser of what we already have.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with your biggest takeaway from this video: the statistics of car production. Never would I have imagined that the manufacturing of zero-emission cars would total to be 15-68% more than that of the production of gasoline vehicles. I was always very naive and trusting of the fact that "electric vehicle" would be environmentally friendly. Looking back, the steadfast advertisement of these zero-emission vehicles to be entirely eco-friendly was simply too good to be true. Of course, the question of whether or not to buy vehicles for the sake of complying with the American way of life or just for the pleasure of owning one for ourselves will inevitably be raised. Hopefully, our nation will be able to take a step back from its cultural shaming of utilizing mass transportation for the purpose of lessening our carbon footprint.
<br><hr>
I agree with your comment wholeheartedly. I have also find that" a manufactured car is already equivalent to releasing two metric tons of CO2" to be an eye-opening phrase. I realized that it doesn't matter if a car is in used or not, as long as you have bought it and the title is under your name, then you are contributing just as much carbon emission to the environment as everyone. Although I really like the idea that there is no future in cars as you mentioned, I believe there is a future to the automobile industry if we just redirect or create something that will replace the resources needed to build a car. As much as I love the suggestion idea that Hiltner provided, It will take a while for us to completely switch our habits in terms of transportation system. Due to the fact that we rely heavily on automobiles and that there is an on-going profitable market in the world of automobiles. Furthermore, just like you, I very much agree with Professor Ken's statement that we as human species should change our cultural practices if we really want to achieve our drastic goals in reducing global carbon emission. Also, I very much understand your point in terms of tech innovations. While it is true that tech innovations alone will not be the solution to climate crisis, I believe tech innovations will supplement how we deal towards our carbon emission in the next coming years. Technology will always find a way to assimilate towards an issue, although you are right that it won't be enough to solve the climate crisis, it will definitely lead us to a direction that no one could ever imagine when we solve the climate crisis. Thus, we need to shift our cultural practices together as a start.
<br><hr>
It was surprising to me as well how much a car can hurt our planet without even being driven. I never really understood the true value of public transposition until I want to Europe for along period of time. Traveling from city to city in different countries by train really showed me the value there was in trains because of what they allowed me to do. This is the same for buses when traveling within a city because in the United States I never used a bus when I just had my car. I thought it would be too inconvenient to use a bus in California but I was very wrong about that. The United States needs to get on a European standard for example when it comes to public transportation. If we are able to implement more trains like that of BART in the Bay Area, travelling from one city to another in a large area would be reducing our carbon footprint drastically. I always thought that electric cars would be the future, but this class has shed light on the fact that they are still an inefficient way to deal with climate change in the long run as well. In order for our carbon footprint to change within the United States, our culture needs to change and accommodate the beauty that public transportation does for us.
<br><hr>
I was totally agree with you when you saw the statistics that “a manufactured car is already equivalent to releasing two metric tons of CO2” Now I am little bit ashamed about people right now. Since we, or most people, realize the problem that a car can produce so much carbon dioxide to atmosphere, we are still driving them, or purchasing them, even purchase more than one car for a family, and I cannot see any nobleness in this action. And the thing is that my friends around me all purchase cars that fuels by petroleum. I think it’s unbelievable. Living on campus won’t be much different from living far away from campus. Yet they choose to live in a extremely squandering way, not only on money, but also on Earth. Taking public transportation makes no difference, but it greatly reduce the carbon emission. I think if we are going to reduce the number of cars in our future, we need to have a better and more efficient transportation system. I understand that it might be hard to transform into this way, but I really believe that new transportation styles can easily take over as a new trendy topic.
<br><hr>
Same as a Chinese international student, I could not agree more with you. I am also shock by the statistics that they is a 10000% increase in car industry in the past 30 years. As the most populated countries in the world, many major or big cities have a huge amount of population and is really crowed. Because of the large amount of people, driving on road in these cites is really inconvenient and time consuming comparing to public transportations like subways. So people tend to choice public transportations in big cites. This reduce the emission and is good for environment conservation. However, just like you said, in the suburban and rural area, where public transportation is less developed and less crowed, people will drive their own cars because it is more convenient. China is a developing countries and many places are still suburban and growing. More and more people living in these cities, like me, will choose to buy cars to get them wherever they want so the car consumption will continue to rise. This is a bad sign for preventing emission. In order to reduce the cars used, I think that government should develop better public transportation systems everywhere, not only in China but also around the world. If we can do this, the amount of emission per year will definitely drop and it will contribute to the prevention of climate change.
 <br><br>


Also, I agree with Ken that car usage is a cultural issue. Nowadays, cars starts to become a symbol of the social status of a person. The more cars and more expensive the cars a person owns, it shows that he or she is more wealthy and successful. People have vanity. Many of them are willing to show off their wealth and power, so they will buy more cars. This will also cause dramatic increase in carbon emission. Ken is right. Science itself cannot stop climate change. It is the social idea and ethos that needed to be adjusted if we want to change our current situation.
<br><hr>

The cost behind manufacturing is not unknown to me, but I think changing people’s habits to public transportation is going to need some institutional changes. As this comment says, right now public transportation is “slow, unorganized, chaotic and potentially dangerous”. Thinking about Los Angeles, where my family lives, there is no public transportation that you don’t have to walk at least 20 minutes to get to, and the routes aren’t direct. And you can’t really bike because there aren’t very many bike lanes and it’s dangerous sharing the road with vehicles. 
 <br><br>

Here in Santa Barbara, the options are a lot better, and I think that has a huge effect on people’s use of it. There are many bike paths that are separate from vehicle roads, and buses have many stops around Isla Vista. But we’re still in need of a bus that goes from Isla Vista to Calle Real. So I think cities have to invest in that kind of infrastructure. It’s impossible to expect people to change behavior when there isn’t a realistic alternative. That’s why I think we have to advocate for institutional change hand-in-hand with cultural changes to actually utilize those new resources.
 <br><br>

This analogy works well with many sectors of human life. We can’t just rely on new technologies to replace what we have. We just have too much right now. So we have to reduce our consumption and actually start investing in materials that are worth it and have a minimal impact. We have to start making our communities shaped in a way that makes it easy to live a low-impact life too, so that people don’t have to do it on their own.
<br><hr>
I absolutely agree with you. Ken’s statements in this video have been revealing and thought provoking. For decades, the electric car has essentially been presented as the “solution” to the climate crisis and yet manufacturing an electric car actually produces 15-58% more greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than a similar gasoline car. Clean transportation and innovations in green energy are beneficial but I think we must always consider the whole picture. In this case, instead of focusing on an electric cars we should focus on improving and innovating the public transport systems. 
 <br><br>


Inherently, public transportation is in and of itself better for the environment relative to cars. As stated in the video, “a bus is 14 times more efficient, a subway 20 times more so, and a passenger train 30 times more efficient” than an automobile. Furthermore, we should apply technological innovations to try and make public transportation systems more clean and environmentally friendly to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. (I’m aware that many such initiatives are already in place and I strongly believe that the implementation of such technologies should be more widespread.)
 <br><br>


The other facet of the situation is really the sheer popularity of cars. Especially in U.S. which consists of 4% of the world’s population but a quarter of all its cars. Unfortunately, as with many other things, the world has modeled the example that America has set. Since the U.S. economy was literally built on the consumerism of automobiles in the 1900s, it makes sense that the car has come to symbolize freedom and independence — arguably two of America’s most important core values and principles. However nowadays, I believe that the majority of us favor practicality and convenience in our daily lives. When public transportation becomes more convenient and practical, it will become more widespread, and when it becomes more widespread and commonplace, the popularity of public transportation will increase until it’s considered normal and expected to commute by bus, train, or subway. This can already be seen in cities like Beijing, Paris, and New York. 
 <br><br>


Finally, considering that traffic accidents are in fact the leading cause of death for young people over the age of 10, as long as public transportation doesn’t seem too expensive, too uncomfortable, or too time consuming, I’m certain that over time, if we combine STEM innovations and the humanities, we can make public transportation the new “cool” and eventually the new normal.
<br><hr>
I agree with your comment that cultural change is what is really needed to confront the climate crisis. I think the reason that technological advancements and scientific progress are so often hyped up as solutions to the climate crisis aren't actually because of actual belief in their ability to solve the issue or real faith in science, but rather because these advancements allow for little to no real effort or change on the part of the individual human. Humans are lazy and averse to change, and so when given any way to solve a problem or simply silence the issue while getting out of doing any real work, they will wholeheartedly take the option. Scientific progress in the way of electric cars that "reduce" emissions from driving give humans this option. It gives lazy humans a way to say they are "doing something for the climate", when really they are just buying a new, trendy, cool-looking, convenient car, that in reality emits nearly as much as their old alternatives. Science itself and the progress it has made are amazing and arguably the greatest achievements of the human race, but using science broadly to sidestep real responsibility and hard work is malicious and far too easy. To really confront this climate crisis there can be no shortcut or easy way out; saving our planet and reversing our mistakes will be an arduous and profoundly life-changing process, and trying to avoid that only dooms us further.
<br><hr>
I agree with this comment.  It is totally astonishing how much CO2 is released with motor vehicles.  And the fact that we think electrical cars do not release any CO2 is absurd.  Cars are a big problem.  All types of cars, the fact that cars are getting more and more appealing is making people more likely purchase one.  They are so popular as well,  around the world vehicles have become the number 1 means of transportation.  Because of this CO2 is being produced into the atmosphere at crazy amounts.  This is only making the climate crisis worse and worse.  Ken stated that in 2017 car ownerships grew 10,000% in just over a decade.  This is so crazy, the fact that this growth took place only tells you how much more CO2 has been released into the atmosphere.  Public transportation is a huge factor in being able to cut down on so much CO2 beign released into the atmosphere.  Ken stated in his video that you can travel 750 miles on a single gallon of gasoline.  This was astonishing to me the fact that you can travel that much and save so much CO2 from being released is astonishing.  As well as, it is possible to travel from L.A. to New York with just 4 gallons of gas.  A bus is 14 times more efficient, a subway is 20 times more efficient, and a train is 30 times more efficient.  This is all in fact public transportation, on public transportation many many people can travel at once.  Rather than one person in a single car traveling that distance.
<br><hr>

I am just as astonished as you are when I heard that a manufactured car is already equivalent to releasing two metric tons of Co2. Basically, even if we get an electric car or not, we are still adding to the climate crisis because of the manufacturing process. The fact that Tesla states that their car is a “zero-emission car” is an example of how major companies use false statements in order to benefit themselves and make more money. It is crazy how money can affect individuals and their thinking process.  I as well have many guy friends who obsess over expensive and sporty cars. They will spend so much money making their car louder, add certain features and styles. I believe that this is apart of the “American Dream” category because we are taught that having multiple cars, a big house and many new and expensive things represents successfulness which will lead to a happy life. But, this perception is false as I was educated on these aspects with all Ken’s lectures and required readings/movies. Ken’s video on the U.S. following WWII does do an extremely amazing job explains our obsession in cars. 
 <br><br>

A previous film called, “Tomorrow,” was analyzing how switching from cars to bikes and other modes of transportation can really have an impact in the long run but public transportation in America is AWFUL. It is quite dirty, slow, chaotic and time consuming. I do see the benefits of having your own car but if half of us switch to other modes of transportation, we will be making a huge impact on the earth. This being said, I believe that we should work on free modes of public transportation.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with you and I share the same idea with you as well. When Tesla and Elon Musk become famous, a lot of people including myself think we found a solution and this would greatly help the global warming issue. It sounds good but when we dig into deep we will see it is not true. Also I agree with you idea about technology will not solve this problem. We all know people since last century know the temperature is increasing, but they are not worry about it because they know our technology will improve and people in the future with better technology can solve this issue better than us, so we can leave it to them. If we think about it today again, people in the future will think like this as well. There is no ending and no solutions. The only solution is start today with what we have. In the future, the technology will improve sure, we can solve this issue with higher efficiency that day,  but at today, we have to act with what can and what we have. We can not push and push, wait and wait.
<br><hr>
I hadn't even realized what that quote truly meant when I heard it. It is so completely shocking to think that just owning a car without ever using it, it has already contributed to such a large carbon footprint. Yet, billions of cars are being driven every single day, at all times in the world. Just trying to imagine how much CO2 is being emitted hurts my brain. I was a huge supporter of electric cars, and I am still am when I compare them to gasoline cars, because of its claims to be zero emission. This claim does not however take the manufacturing process into consideration, and like you mentioned, it is depressing. I certainly want to own a car in the future and was set on getting an electric car to reduce my impact on the environment, but knowing the amount of CO2 was put into making the car is making me rethink purchasing a car.
 <br><br>
Throughout my entire life, I have used public transportation. I grew up in San Francisco and our public transportation system is very good compared to areas outside of major cities. Yet despite our better public transportation, there is a cultural disdain for the transit system. There is a cultural preference for cars over public transportation and this was extremely true in San Francisco. In school, students would dread taking the bus because the buses would be unreliable. Buses weren't always on time and sometimes would break down or be dirty. Something I've noticed is that people don't like to be in close proximity to strangers, especially on public transportation, and would much rather prefer the comfort and speed of an Uber ride. Cars are thought to be cooler, better, and more convenient because it can drop you off at your exact location. Public transportation can be advanced and be seen in higher regard if the same amount of effort is put into them that is currently being put into advancing cars, which are already far more technologically advanced than buses. A transit system I'd like to mention are the ones in Japan, which are much more efficient and always clean, and regarded as an excellent way of transportation. I think this is an interesting cultural difference in how we view public transportation. I agree that there needs to be both technological and cultural changes in order for real changes in the climate crisis.

<br><hr>

I completely agree that technology innovations alone will not solve the climate crisis. Like Ken said, we need to make use of our public transportation system and cut down drastically (or in a perfect world, completely) on automobile usage. I was shocked that simply buying a car is already releasing 2 tons of CO2; I knew that using the car contributes to global warming but I never factored in the manufacturing process into that. While the electric car is a better alternative to the gasoline car, its manufacturing process still releases a lot of CO2. 
 <br><br>

I recently visited Japan this summer, and I was amazed at how fast, efficient, clean, and most importantly, inexpensive, its public transportation was. Most people in Japan do not own cars; they use the subway trains instead. America and the rest of the developed world should follow in Japan's footsteps and develop a GOOD public transportation system. I agree with you that the current public transportation system is inefficient, slow, and chaotic. This is because our lawmakers simply do not care enough about the negative impact of vehicle emissions to create a better public transportation system. We really should prioritize creating a better public transportation and reducing the use of cars in order to solve the climate crisis.
<br><hr>

I agree with your idea that technological innovations alone are not the solution to climate change. I had this preconception that technology will solve all of the world’s problems growing up. Looking at the present state of climate change, I believed that innovations such hybrid and fully electric cars will radically curb our trajectory towards disaster. Maybe one day, just as today’s tech is incomprehensible to the past, technology will allow future generation to achieve things unimaginable to us. From reversing climate change to building an O’Neill cylinder to terraforming mars, tech appears to have many fascinating ways to solve climate change. However, just as Ken said, a point that you also emphasized, there are hidden costs to such technologies. As an example, even though a Tesla has zero emissions, it’s far from environmentally friendly. Rare earth material used to make the battery and the co2 emitted from the construction is enormous. I can’t imagine what kind of hidden costs and consequences of massive infrastructures needed to take on ambitious projects such as the O’Neill cylinder. The fact that we can’t and should depend of tech to solve climate change some point in the future is the reason why changes need to happen now. We should do whatever we can from riding on public transport to limiting our individual carbon footprint. Perhaps we shouldn’t expect our problems to be solved by cool and mind-blowing concepts and instead focus on more pragmatics solutions and be willing to make sacrifices.
<br><hr>

I agree with your idea. In order to save this fragile planet, switching traditional gas burning cars into electric cars won’t be a feasible solution. Like Ken comparing the carbon emission per capita for humans to doctors’ suggested daily energy requirements, I would like to compare people’s switching a fat-based diet into a carb-base diet. Yes, that sounds a lot more healthier and yes, carbs generally have a less calorie density than fats, but, you still have a high chance of getting diabetes, high blood pressure and strokes because it raises your glucose level in blood almost as fast as the saturated fat. 
 <br><br>

In addition to understanding why the seemingly effective solution to the problem won’t work, I was also shocked by the statistics Ken gave. Why is it that our lifetime carbon emissions equal to the manufacturing process of one single car. Not only surprised by how damaging modern technology is to our environment, I was also blown away by the effect our growing population has on our planet. One of the cultural problems is too many people. In order to feed this growing population, the environment will not be taken into consideration eventually at some point in the future. We need to educate the females in undeveloped countries for a better life with more choice for them and a better earth.
 <br><br>

Apart from that, the proposal of getting it to be a trend to use public transportation is really worth taking into consideration. The money that we invested in developing electric cars should be instead put into the infrastructures. With public transportation being a more convenient and cooler way to travel, people would be more than happy to alter their choice.

<br><hr>

I agree, I didn’t realize how naive I was. I thought electric cars were the answer but little did I know I was wrong. I feel like people where i’m from don’t ever use public transportation. In fact, I don’t even know if there’s a lot of public transportation around. (busses) If there were more though, it would make such a big difference. I try my best to not use my car as much but even just owning a car I didn’t know could cause so much damage. It’s so sad to see how little the world knows about what they are doing to this planet because before this video I had no clue how big my footprint really was. The funny thing is I actually considered mine to be small.
<br><hr>
Before I watch “Why the climate crisis is a cultural problem (and why electric cars are more trouble than good),” I was gullied by the story that Tesla is more environmental-friendly than other cars, and I believe that many of us are gullied as well. After watching Ken’s video, I realize that the main issue that we should concern more about is the designing procedure of cars, instead of what kind of model of cars should I buy, because what really matters is the origin of the issue. What I mean here is not that we should give up on public transportations. We should focus on reducing the emission during making cars, as well as reduce our daily car use. Both of them can exist together.
<br><hr>

I had a similar reaction to this video-It seems like we really need to focus our energy on creating more sustainable transportation methods if we want to get ahead of climate change. I feel like I am someone who tries to think about my environmental impact often when it comes to what items I buy and which companies I give money to, but I hardly ever think about my carbon footprint transportation-wise. I think the reason why I don't think about this often is because it feels like, for me, there are no other options. If I need to get home for the weekend, I never consider taking the greyhound when I have a car here to use. I'm not saying this is justified - actually, it's completely counter-intuitive. How can I say I am passionate about solving the climate crisis when I constantly do the single worst thing for the environment: drive.

I think one of the best ways to fix this issue is to improve public transportation. Companies should, instead of spending millions on developing new hybrid cars, work towards more efficient buses and trains. If there was a fast and cheap way to get home on public transportation, I would be much more likely to forgo my car.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with you! When I heard the statistics professor Ken gave, I was shocked to see that manufacturing a car and having it parked is already the max of CO2 emissions we could release per year. To me, that statistic is just crazy to think about, especially since this number does not factor other everyday uses such as the production of food, clothing, and other manufacturing goods. I was also oblivious to think that cars advertised as zero-emission are actually true to their statement. This does not include the actual manufacturing process to make the car which alone releases tons of CO2. Living in Santa Barbara for college has made it a lot easier to commute by walking, taking a bus, or biking, but it's especially hard at home. When I travel home, I usually look for people who are also driving the same way in order to carpool and lessen our carbon footprint. At home however, I find myself driving to locations I could easily commute by bus and I have decided to try and change that. Buses could be a bit inconvenient but knowing the benefits it could have in the long run is worth it. This has influenced me to think about how much CO2 I alone produce and how I change some of my actions for the better.
<br><hr>
I agree with you, I also did not realize that the manufacturing of cars also causes greenhouse gasses emissions. We do need to change our cultural practices of the luxury of cars. I was thinking that what if we put in financial aid towards transportation systems instead of building cars. This could potentially lead us to a better direction. The only problem is people willing to do it. The professor points out that if we advertise buses and trains to be "cool" and appealing maybe it can change the cultural aspect. If people demand less for cars then car manufacturing will lower and bus and train manufacturing would increase.

<br><hr>
The data given by Ken is really astonishing and alarming. I had never thought about the exact amount of  CO2 emitted by cars. Human is under the huge pressure of limited resources, but a lot of people still have no idea how much resources they wasted. I agree with your idea that the solution to the climate crisis is never a personal effort. If everyone makes a little change, the tiny changes will be accumulated as a significant change to the environment. When the products human used exceeds the basic needs a lot, they would be nothing but the waste of natural resources. Humans do not have to buy extra products to save energy. Fulfilling basic needs is already a great effort.
<br><hr>
I also found this statistic to be very striking and surprising. I was somewhat aware of the fact that fuel powered cars were very detrimental to the planet, but never fully considered the environmental consequences of the productions of cars. Furthermore, I felt that the wave and trend of zero-emission cars and electric cars there was hope for a better substitute for the future. However, this lecture really opened my eyes of how cars may not be the best option of transportation at all. In fact, the future of society to becoming more environmentally conscious is a society in which public transportation is the common method of transportation. I feel though that this is a very tricky problem to solve, even though we have an obvious answer to reducing the planet's carbon footprint. We have had many generations throughout history that have used cars as the "best" and "easiest" way of getting around. Having a car or getting a new car has become a milestone in everyday lives, and suddenly taking this away from the desiring eyes of consumers is not an easy act. Furthermore, I also found it very eye-opening when Ken's lecture made me think of all the times in which I have been told public transportation is good for the environment. This is a fact that everyone knows, yet we don't act on it. Instead, we merely acknowledge that we are aware of the benefits of public transportation and continue to use and buy cars. I felt very embarrassed at my own ignorance to this fact and mostly considering carpooling to be of the same environmentally friendly option as public transportation. This is obviously not the case due to the release of two metric tons of CO2 during the manufacturing of a car. I feel as though there needs to be great reconsideration and reflection about the daily routines of our lives as we are misinformed and not vigilant in maintaining a healthy planet.
<br><hr>
I very much agree with your points. What I think is what people primarily forget about is the sole fact that there is a process to all of these carbon-emitting items and developments. These are processes that emit even more carbon. In this way, people seem to forget that their efforts to curb climate change are actually speeding it up. What if you need to drive to the grocery store to pick up anything but beef? You're still using some sort of vehicle, and it'd most likely be something that emits carbon. There's nothing that we can do in this day and age that won't emit carbon. We'd have to devolve our technological developments, since mostly everything nowadays is run on some sort of greenhouse gas. When people travel the world, even if it's for a sustainability project, they're most likely buying themselves a plane ticket. They're carbon footprint increases drastically. Nowadays, there's nothing that we can do except to try and slow it down. I won't buy an electric car if that means harming the environment without doing me any good. I agree though that people should start carpooling or extendjing their usage of public transportation. While this process does increase their carbon footprint, it'd still make less than a single person. Together, we need to start thinking about the process over the end result and make sure what we're doing is right.
<br><hr>

I completely agree with your perspective about how impactful the statement of how much CO2 released by a manufactured car (electric and gas). I think we need to do a better job as a society of educating ourselves about the environmental effects of having a car. Although electric cars seem like the future, there are still a major component of CO2 emissions. Perhaps, we should reframe the ideas of transportation and make public transportation more accessible in suburban and rural area. I think the biggest fault in our car manufacturer history is after WWII, when people were encouraged to move to rural and suburban areas. This led to the massive manufacturing in vehicles and has since contributed to the idea that having a car is a must in American society. I think we need to look at cities like New York, whose public transportation system is well maintained, and implement these systems to other major cities. Public transportation should be looked at as something that is beneficial and efficient, rather than something that is not reliant. This video really educated me about car contribution to CO2 levels and encouraged me to take the train back home for the three day weekend! Overall, the government should be putting more money into public transportation systems throughout the United States.
<br><hr>
I thoroughly agree with the statement that tech innovations alone will not be enough to solve the ongoing climate crisis.  As Ken insightfully points out, the production process of electric cars emits two metric tons of CO2. However, what we must fail to do is to objectively claim that electric cars are just as bad as regular cars due to this sole statistic. Now what I do agree with is that it is still adding to the crisis. For instance, one thing that occurred to me is that most of these electric cars must be powered from some source of energy. Which lead me to think that the energy which will aid in charging the cars are sourced from the nation’s electrical grid. To further deconstruct this, this means that the electrical power supply is only as sustainable as America’s mix of power sources. These power sources are mainly met through the burning of fossil fuels and natural gas. However, with everything in this world, there are always some drawbacks and I personally feel that electric cars are still a great step in the right direction. Now, most people desire solutions that will have large impacts however, we must understand that we must learn how to crawl first before running. Little steps in the right direction go a great distance. Thus, although electric cars aren't 100% sustainable and environmentally friendly, they do significantly reduce the overall carbon emissions and are a much more suitable alternative to regular cars.
<br><hr>

I agree with you that tech innovations alone will not be the solution to the climate crisis. Before watching this video, I believed that the production of electric cars was the future of driving because of its message of being environmentally friendly, but now I'm disappointed to find out that the construction of so many electric cars has such large carbon footprints. I thought such fancy and ingenious innovations would be the solution for climate change, and I think I need to re-evaluate my position towards electric cars after this week's assignments. Maybe instead of looking to the future for innovations and changes as much as we do at this point in time, perhaps pragmatic and personal change is more important and consequential.
  <br><br>
Most people don't believe that their sole actions can help the environment, but I think that, as you said, every individual in society needs to be aware and work together to tackle the climate crisis. It is so important to respect and believe in each other. In my opinion, if we do at least that, in the near future we can make the planet a better place not only environmentally, but also morally.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that the statistics in this video were very eye-opening and made me rethink a lot about our use of cars. I also did not ever think that making a car has such a significant impact in the environment. Families often have many cars because each person who is an adult has one to get to their jobs, school, etc. And while we might not think that it is too much since all cars are being actively utilized, using cars is makes such a negative impact that our values need to be reevaluated. There are also wealthy individuals who have multiple cars and consistently buy more cars which is incredibly increasing CO2 emissions. I also think that our public transportation system in the United States is not the best, and that is because it is seen as something that is used by those who are unable to afford cars. I wonder what the system could be like if everyone was using public transportation. In cities like New York where public transportation is often preferred, there is still a high use of cars which doesn't help reduce our global footprint. This video also made me rethink my own use of transportation and how I can and should make changes to begin to prioritize using public transportation.

<br><hr>
What you’re saying correctly matches what Ken mentions in this video. If he didn’t tell, I could never know that technology is not the solution that works well regarding the huge amount of pollution through car production. Culturally, the desire of freedom by owning a car instead of using public transportation might only work for first-world economy. Perhaps telling people the pros and cons would help. For third-world countries, a big portion of people can’t go to work without a car, and the car the best choice for them compared to public transportation. Therefore, concerning the endeavors to culturally inspire people giving up private cars, different solutions should be applied to different situations.
<br><hr>

I definitely agree with your statement that both changes in technology and our society's culture are needed to mitigate the consequences of the climate crisis. Although the momentum for the environmental movement has began to pickup within the past decades, it is evident that many people are not aware of the environmental impacts their everyday purchases and actions have on the planet. For example, I was not aware that the manufacturing of a car releases the same amount of CO2 emissions associated to a person's annual contribution. The craze for electric and green vehicles have seem to have blinded people from seeing the real reason for buying these cars- to be eco-friendly. Rather than looking into these cars to be sustainable, many people see zero emissions vehicles such as Tesla's as a statement of status and wealth. I believe that it is important for people to do more research about their purchases, both big and small, to get a better understanding about their own carbon footprint. 
  <br><br>
In addition to encouraging people to learn more about their products, I believe more people should think about how their community can make changes to promote sustainability. Although people are often not fond of public transportation, I believe that of people do more to promote public transportation or carpooling in their neighborhood, then more people would be willing to do so. Additionally, I am familiar with workplaces that encourage their workers to take public transportation by providing a stipend, or even have showers on-site for workers that want to bike to work. These small changes can all help promote a more sustainable lifestyle at home and at the workplace.

<br><hr>
I definitely agree with you and Ken in that a large cultural shift must occur in order to curtail the climate crisis. They are even more important than the technological changes that are often misleading and still detrimental, such as the emission of carbon dioxide in producing electric cars that are typically misunderstood as environmentally friendly. Overconsumption and materialism have become deeply embedded values in our society, and no amount of technology will change that or reduce the effect of it as much as a cultural change in values would. A lot of this has to do with how we as Americans typically define success and the and the value placed on material things, such as cars or clothes. If we were somehow able to diffuse the value of minimalism instead, our carbon footprint as Americans would change dramatically. This is because our crazy consumption levels emit a lot of carbon dioxide in the production of a lot of goods as well as the use of some of them, like cars. This is where the importance of social sciences and humanities becomes apparent, as the issue of climate change has a myriad of social, cultural, and economic causes related to capitalism, consumerism, and American values  in addition to the scientific causes we typically think of as solely being the emission of too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with this statement that technological and cultural aspects of our lives need to change in order to save the climate. Science can only go so far if we are not willing to change our habits and ideas that cars are cool and each individual should own one. I was not aware of the statistics before this video and was shocked to discover how much carbon manufacturing a car actually releases. In order to make a difference, the public has to be convinced that cars are not cool, and more funding should go toward public transport. 
  <br><br>
It is easy to follow this instruction and live without a car in IV, but honestly, I am not so sure I can do this at home in the suburbs. Everything is spaced out and there are not a lot a bus stops present. To fix this issue and convince Americans to stop buying and using cars I believe that one of the first things that needs to be addressed and improved is the public transportation systems. Make them easier to access and more convenient before trying to convince people that cars are not cool, because in our busy lives one of the priorities is convenience. If that is not fixed first I do not think it will be easy for people to make the change.
<br><hr>

This statistic truly encompasses the difficulty of the environmental crisis. Is there an emission-free future with cars? No. Is there a realistic way everyone can get about their daily lives without cars? No. So what is the solution? I think an alternative would be to transition to electric cars as fast as possible (as we are doing), but afterwards start phasing cars out of our society slowly. 
  <br><br>


The main reason cars are so important in the United States is because there is no reliable way to get from the suburbs where the majority of the population lives to the cities where most work. However, with the rise of the internet, Skype, and web industries, a huge portion of these jobs are actually transitioning to work at home jobs. This presents a situation where a large portion of people no longer have to commute on a daily basis and as such would no longer need a car. Rather than trying to figure out the impossible, logistical nightmare of trying to accommodate public transportation for one of the largest, most spread out countries in the world, I think that an easier solution would be to optimize our lifestyles to minimize the need for travel. 

  <br><br>

More so than people wanting to help the planet, phasing cars out will take an entire cultural change because at the end of the day we currently need cars to get to the jobs we depend on to survive. I think electric cars are not a solution but rather a band-aid fix that will eventually need to be ripped off once the rest of our society adapts to a more environmentally suitable lifestyle.

<br><hr>
I exactly agree with what you said, “both technological advances and cultural changes must be made in order for us to make an impact on the climate crisis. STEM scientists, social scientists, and every individual in society need to be aware and work together to tackle the climate crisis. “however, though it is shocker that during the process of manufacturing the car. We have already consumed a huge amount of carbon dioxide. But it does not mean that we should not use car. Some cars like Toyota Prius and Tesla is still convenient and environmentally friendly for people to use. 

  <br><br>

We should not reject the technology that we have produced even if they are positive to the environment. Accepting the current situation and use the modern technology with a usual mind is essential for us. maybe for me, as a student in UCSB, riding bike during the weekdays to school and driving car during yhe weekend for fun is the best choice for environmentally friendly.
<br><hr>

I agree that it is crazy to see that just owning a car hits the threshold of emitting our 2 metric tons of CO2. When I thought about this, i realized that we must be letting so much more CO2 in the atmosphere through our driving and when you think about the fact that many people have their own personal car, the CO2 emissions really stack up. This is a big problem because we are consistently putting out emissions that cannot be slowed down due to the fact that we are so dependent on our cars. If we were able to be more efficient with our resources and use them on things that we really needed we would be able to slow down our emissions and look for better solutions to our climate crisis. The cultural impact for us is so prominent due to the fact that we were born into this world with the preconceived notion that we need to be comfortable and we need to make advances in order for us to have better lives when in fact, we are self destructing. We are doing things that shouldn't be done and should be stopped so that we will be able to enjoy life on this planet while we can. We need to do the things in our power to slow down our emissions and not look for ways to advance technologically, but for ways to advance environmentally.
<br><hr>

It is so important to note that we need a cultural change instead of wasting our time to figure out how could we make a more efficient engine. Unlike the U.S, China has a popular culture of taking public transportation. It is not about class or anything related to social hierarchy to take the buses or metro to commute or even to travel. One part of it may be that China indeed places a focus on the construction of public transportation in recent years. Another part of it is that public transportation cost significantly less than buying a car. However, in the U.S where carbon emission per capita is 6 time of that in China, people are fascinated with cars. When I first came to the U.S, I was so surprised to find out that the average American Household has some 2 or more cars. There are certainly reasons for such an auto-loving culture in this highly developed country.  On one hand, it may seem necessary for households to have more than 1 car since the family size in the U.S is significantly large compared to a typical Chinese family under the influence of the one-child policy. It seems natural for people to have these transportation tools to carry more family members. One the other hand, the consumer culture in the U.S greatly contributes to such fascination about cool cars. Nearly everywhere in this country you could observe a trace of commercial advertising, and as people are exposed to them ubiquitously they intend to follow their inner "call" to consume. So the problems with high carbon footprint and the associated culture are that they are so steady as if they are the innate traits born with a person. So it is never easy to actually change the cultural part of this world. And partly because most developed countries on this planet have a capitalist mindset, essentially a majority of ordinary people would try to climb the social ladder and dreaming to live a life like a millionaire. But no one is to be blamed for since the desire or the intentions to live a "better" or "good" life are encouraged everywhere on this planet. No parents would like to see their children living without abundant wealth or simply put: not rich. So one could see that consumerism and the culture revolving it which might be causing the climate crisis are socially impossible or at least uneasy to be changed.
<br><hr>
I was also shocked by the fact that we have already reached the maximum amount of emission for simply owning a car because “a manufactured car is already equivalent to releasing two metric tons of CO2.” I always thought that electric cars would help the climate crisis because the advertisements always include how it is the better option out of what is currently available. Therefore, Tesla’s zero-emission car also gave me hope for the future, but knowing this fact now diminishes my hope regarding cars and the climate crisis. It also saddens me to know that there is a ‘cool cars’ culture that promotes buying many cars instead of using public transportation because of its contribution to the climate crisis as numerous people do not consider the carbon dioxide release due to manufacturing a car.
  <br><br>

I agree that the climate crisis is a cultural problem and not a technological problem. Today’s culture definitely favors cars over public transportation buses. I also agree that the public transportation system, especially here in Santa Barbara, is not perfect. However, I do believe that it is manageable and that the benefits of riding the bus to help lower one’s carbon footprint exceeds the disadvantages. This sacrifice is especially worth the effort to ensure that the planet continues to be habitable.
<br><hr>

My reaction was exactly like yours Jay, I was surprised to learn about the massive toll the production of electric cars have on the environment. The electric car industry have advertised themselves as being the ultimate solution to the climate crisis while on quite the contrary they are no better than their gas guzzling counterparts in the big picture. The true future to the solution of the climate crisis is public transportation. I think it would be great if we could make public transportation free to all people as a truly public transportation system but that may be a problem for another time. On the side of electric cars, it is deeply irresponsible that they put out these eco-friendly messages while they keep quiet on the massive CO2 emissions put out for the productions of their vehicles. The biggest obstacle for sure is changing the cultural mindsets ingrained into our american brains that we need cars. Public transportation is the much more viable option but for because it is the cultural norm, we turn to cars. Hopefully one days our roads will be filled with buses and not cars.

<br><hr>



this comment really caught my attention. The statistic that a "manufactured car is already equivalent to releasing two metric tons of CO2" definitely came as a surprise to me. Simply put, just owning a car puts us in a bad position. Most, if not virtually everyone, utilizes a car multiple times after purchase. That's tons of added CO2 on top of the two metric tons you already added to your "CO2 bill." Again, this comment held some valuable information. Technological advancements always seem so great but we never look beyond the benefits. Electric cars are so cool when you look at all the tech that goes into it, the speed, no gas needed, etc. although in reality it doesn't do much to help with the climate crisis! This lecture video definitely solidifies the fact that humans need to fundamentally change the way we think, as technology is not the only answer...
  <br><br>
Ken does an amazing job at explaining the history on what we are so attached to our cars. In retrospect, buses, trains, subways, biking, walking, etc. are all better alternatives to having a car although you see how many people own a car! If we want to change from cars to public transportation, that involves a huge mental, individual, collective, and cultural shift.
<br><hr>
I was shocked to hear that if you buy one car every 11 years, and NEVER drive them, you will be using up your carbon budget for LIFE. This is absolutely insane to me. I have always looked at cars the way most of us have: a source of freedom in our lives. However, after this lecture, I will never be able to look at them the same way. My family bought a Tesla a few years ago and soon after bought another electric car. I have always been very happy with my family's awareness of the climate crisis and my family and I was very proud with our use of electric cars, but now I can see how bad having ANY car is. 

  <br><br>

I agree that we need to change our culture drastically. We also need people to change our infrastructure dramatically. The way our mass transportation is set up in the majority of the US is abysmal, and no one will want to choose it over cars with the way it is set up right now. If we implemented some of the same strategies as other places, like Bogotá's bus system with their own lanes, we may see a huge decrease in the number of cars on the road, and number of cars purchased in general. 

  <br><br>

We also need to advertise the poor qualities of buying cars, just like we advertised the harms of cigarettes. If people knew that they were using up their sustainable carbon emissions budget for the year just by buying a car, I am sure that there would be a lot of people who would choose not to buy the car, especially once we have the infrastructure for an effective mass transportation system.
<br><hr>
It’s totally understandable to be pessimistic about the cultural shift cuz if that’s easy, we’ll have no need to discuss and call for change. Everything regarding culture could not be made in a rush, but gradually. And I really agree with what you are talking about in regards to the governmental support. It is just like the videos Ken showed to us about the mass transit in Bogota and Barcelona. I am surprised and shocked by the fast implements taken in these developing countries. The local politicians and officials are trying their best to restrain the use and right of car use and parking, widening bike lanes, and killing the stigma of taking mass transit. However, it will be harder for the US to do the same thing cuz apparently most of the politicians are not with us in consensus to the climate crisis, and the majority are still funded by fossil fuels corporations like Koche Brother. So I just want to say that, this will be a hard and long war, but what I’m trying to change is my personal attitude so far in order to better protect the environment around my area.
<br><hr>
 I agree with you on the fact that people always ignore the amount of CO2 car manufacturing process releases and that even though technology, electric vehicle, helps reduce the amount of CO2 a car releases, it still exceeds the amount that public transportation contributes. In fact, I think underground public transportation is a great strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emission, because not only it’s more efficient in energy using, but also it creates more space for people on the ground, so maybe more people would choose to ride bikes.
  <br><br>
In addition, i think technology and culture are complement in face of climate change. Technology will definitely help mitigate greenhouse gas emission as much as it can in the future with change of old concept.
<br><hr>
I entirely agree with your whole comment. In class we talk so much about CO2 emissions from cars that I never really thought about what really goes into producing them. Electric cars really aren't the big improvement we thought they were and like you said, we were naive and the realization is quite depressing. As the future for cars is diminishing for some, more than ever we need to fund and make use of public transportation. Like Ken said about his past student, public transportation needs to be seen as cool and the best way to get from place to place because the negative aura it has isn't helping. I get that cars are super cool and can be seen as a freedom but we are turning into the automobile's slave as we sit in traffic and ruin the earth by each car we put on the road. Public transportation is the best solution and we have more than enough technology to make the most efficient super-speed trains or easy access buses. I know that tech is the smallest factor in this but it is an important step. I wholeheartedly agree that a cultural change is the most important factor in this movement. People need to stop worrying about what makes them look rich and think about practicalities. Communities and the world need to tackle this together so we can make the change needed to help the planet.
<br><hr>
I agree with your disbelief in the sense that it is eye opening to discover how impactful owning just ONE car is to our carbon footprints. Prior to being exposed to this information, I had always thought if you own a car and use it sparingly and when necessary it would be "ok," or at least not detrimental to the environment. Like you said, there really is no hope for climate change mitigation in the future if we do not erase ownership of cars from the picture. The problem is, however, that so many consumers in today's society rely on cars as a primary method of transportation being that its fast, easy, and convenient (I am guilty of this myself). What's even more unsettling is the thought that just manufacturing a car has just as much or even more of a carbon footprint the owning one. The global population is skyrocketing and to even imagine even more cars are being produced to satisfy human desires is scary. Right now, shutting down car manufacturers would be impossible because of how much money circulates around that industry and with population and demand increasing, production has no choice but to increase simultaneously. So, whats next? It seems like we are sort of doomed in this positive feedback loop of consumerism and carbon expenditure with no reversal button or "way out." For now, like you and Ken said both, we can continue doing what we find in our best interests for the world- taking the subway, riding a bike, or riding a train.
<br><hr>

I shared the same reaction when hearing that owning a car alone exceeds the amount we should emit, even when not using it, and not taking into account any of our other activities that emit carbon into the atmosphere. I also thought that Tesla was the new genius way of saving the world and reducing carbon emission into the atmosphere, and I'm disappointed to learn that this isn't quite true due to the manufacturing of the car. Decades ago, the public view chose the suburban lifestyle, where families have multiple cars, as the ideal way of living. The video does a very good job of explaining the reason for this increase in cars after WWII, and it makes sense now that our culture is so geared towards cars. Everyone cannot wait to drive, and jumps at the opportunity of first getting a permit, then a license. Driving, for me, gives me a sense of freedom and responsibility that I hadn't really felt before driving my own car. However, what nobody is aware of is how dangerous this is not only for our safety, but our environment, too. A switch to public transportation would be extremely difficult for me, but this video opened up the possibility for me using it more frequently. I wish more people knew just how important it is to just not own a car, and I really hope this information spreads as soon as possible. If our society slowly began prioritizing the environment over personal satisfaction, maybe the car business would drop, less would be produced, and therefore less carbon would be emitted into the atmosphere.
<br><hr>
It also never occurred to me that one of the reasons why public transit is so bad is because they are competing with car manufacturers and the car manufacturers have worked with politicians so that public transit does not get enough money. This creates a transit system that no one will use because it's so bad but no more money will be put into the transit system because not many people use it in the first place. Back in my hometown there are only 3 bus lines and they only go through the main streets. If you lived a little far away you'd have to walk miles to the nearest bus stop and to do that everyday would take up so much time. There needs to be political change before mass transit could even be viable for the majority of people in the world. Some places have pretty good mass transit but many other places, it is basically complete garbage and a car is the only way to get around.
<br><hr>
I was so shocked about the fact too when I heard about it. All the advertisements that people are hearing all the time are actually mixed with half truth and half falsity, seducing people to get more of the products without feeling guilt. Again, all for the interests of the smaller amount of people, making “minimalism volunteers” waste of resources without their knowledges.
  <br><br>

And I also cannot believe the truth that electrical cars are actually increase the burden of the environment, since more cars are manufactured without counting the usages, more pollutions are created. In my family, we actually own four cars, which my parents actually only use two during their weekdays, while the other two are just put in the garage, and my father always sees my family as environmentalists who use cars as less as possible. He sometimes goes out by bus or just walking. However, with the new knowledge of this video, we have new understandings towards how cars influence the environment and how we can do better in the future.
<br><hr>
Yes, electric cars are not perfect. However they are a major step in the right direction and do not produce the fumes that a gas car does. It also has a lower carbon footprint overall.
<br><hr>

This idea has always been stuck with me. I remember being young and asking my parents why some people had fancy cars. I have never been able to understood the concept. As I have gotten older I applaud my young self for seeing through the flashiness of luxury cars and suvs. While I was unaware of the CO2 emissions or even the concept of the climate crisis I was still onto something. This idea goes back to Minimalism and Walden for me. This is a perfect example of our mindset of stuff and the importance of owning the most that we can to make us happy. The fact that just owning a vehicle and not even driving it reaches our maximum emissions is baffling. Your point on Teslas is spot on. Myself, and I'm sure most of us, viewed Teslas as a 0 emission vehicle or the future or cars in our climate crisis. The manufacturing process of cars and transportation industry as a whole is quite literally ruining our planet. But, as humans we are still obsessed with owning the best of the best. Not only are we thinking completely backwards about the importance of how we look when we drive but we are killing our planet while we do it. To change these things we must go back to the root of the problem, the fact that this is a cultural practice. This will require not only our generation but everyone to change.

I stand with you on this point of view. It was also kind of shocked for me to hear that producing a car will take up one person's a whole's year of allowed carbon emission (and of course, it's not the fanciest racing F1s or huge monster trucks). Wow. One thing that the U.S. is different from  other parts of the world is definitely that, we really RELY on cars. When I studied in my high school in Baltimore county, there's really no way of getting around without a car. There were no buses, and subways? 15 miles away! It's something we have to admit that in suburban areas, public transportation is embarrassing a lot of time. But in big cities, or at least a town, I believe that the situation can change.For example, Santa Barbara is a place the I like its bus system a lot(excluding the weekends). As a college freshmen without a car, buses are crucial for my daily life and they're indeed convenient. I can use Bus Tracker app to see where they are, and I can make plannings of my trip days ahead of time. Although in cities like LA, public transportation may not be as enjoyable, we can still make a change by a viable replanning. And as you mentioned in your comment, we need to change our cultural practices to use less cars but more buses. Only in this way can we help saving our planet.
<br><hr>
I agree that there is no place in the future for the cars of the present, but I genuinely wonder what type of transportation we will need to come up with. As much as I would love to push for public transit as Ken mentioned, that lifestyle seems like a lost cause on the millions of people who own their own cars. I wonder if there could be a way  to make an actual 0 carbon footprint car, and what would it take? Sure it is easy to suggest cars made of recycled materials, but even then the factory building the car has a massive carbon footprint of its own. Perhaps industrialism itself is the core of the problem, but what is the new solution to the wants and needs of millions of people. Electric cars seemed like such a promising product, but in reality it is just another problem.

Ken was very insightful in this video and my eyes were open on this whole zero emission scam. There are many car companies like Toyota and General Motors promising “zero emission” vehicles lately but this is obviously directed at a buyer group that consists of people wanting new, shiny objects, but also pertaining to climate change buyers. As seen in the video, the push to go electric is largely being driven by fears about global warming and the desire to reduce CO2 emissions, but the term "zero emission" is so unbelievably and wildly misleading that I scoff at advertisements and consumerism even more. Yes, the plug-in electric cars that automakers are touting and states like California are mandating don't emit pollutants from their tailpipes, but that doesn't mean they don't contribute to pollution. It just means that the source of the pollution moves from the car to a power plant. That's especially true when it comes to CO2 emissions, which the power plant might pump out in copious amounts, depending on its energy source. Very insightful video, Ken. Thank you for explaining this.

After watching the lecture video my view on the need to move away from the dependency on car as our dominant mode of transportation solidified further. Cars are horrid for the sustainability of our planet and for human existence in the long run. Cars release massive amounts of green gases into the atmosphere not just by their use but also by the process of making them. 
<br><br>
In addition, after watching the video I realized I never really thought about the cons of electric cars. I was naïve. The process of acquiring the materials and then assembling such cars is exhausting/detrimental to the environment. Most people, just like myself are blinded by labels like “electric car” or “hybrid car” and don’t care thereafter about the issue of their carbon footprint. They feel good about themselves because they have chosen alternative options without going in depth into the issue of the climate crisis. We are shallow, and we need to swim deeper into the problem.
</p><hr>


<p>
The idea that stood out to me the most in these weeks lectures is that the time we spent so much working on electric cars and making them emission-free could have been used for advocating for the decrease of car use. Public transportation is way more efficient than the use of personal cars. Now its's even worse. We have public transportation centered on personal vehicles with new conventions such as UBER and LYFT. I think we should focus on making sure that our cities have efficient public station that will allow people to get from one place to another without a hassle. We should make a goal to make public transport more appealing to the public. In other words, we should try to foster a culture where buses, subways and trains is cool. I mean it is 14, 20, and 30 times as efficient as cars, respectively.
</p><hr>

<p>
I never really tied culture to the climate crisis until now. Looking at the issue from this perspective is truly eye opening; in addition, I feel guilty for contributing to the materialism of American culture with the aspects that are held in my current daily lifestyle. The standards that we as a society set have increased tremendously over time. Imagine... The average house space for one family nearly tripled in less than a century. Shifting the focus to transportation, the desire for cars can be compared to any other technological device. Look at the iPhone. Apple’s treasured invention has released a new version of the phone on a nearly yearly basis, adding and promoting new features that strike as appealing to their audience. Cars are marketed in the same fashion. The treatment of these items as accessories beyond their actual function adds to the American culture that values the possession of unnecessary stuff over purpose. If we continue to adhere to this type of culture, our carbon footprint will increase to a point of no return. Instead, more environmentally friendly forms of transportation, like the local buses, subways, and trains should be advertised to promote their greener impact on climate change. I even see the promotion of driving services like Uber and Lyft incorporate the factor of climate. These provided services allow for the reduction of emissions, for there will be one less car to be on the roads.
</p><hr>

<p>
The fact that now there is 1 billion of cars in the world does not surprised me, but the fact that the number will double in 15 years shocked me. Cars, which commits to one fourth of our planet footprint, should be less-use. As Ken suggests, it is important to change the culture. Even though buying a electric car instead of a regular one would help to reduce the footprint, it is still not an efficient way to reduce the greenhouse gas emission overall. Changing the life style would be much more useful like taking the bus, subway or trains instead. However, it’s really hard to achieve.
</p><hr>

<p>
I had no idea that it took more greenhouse gases to create electric cars. As Ken mentioned in the video, “over their lifetime, electric cars generate half the emissions of their gasoline counterparts.” So what’s the problem? Ken raised the question if we should buy one at all in the first place. This video taught me about other external factors that I should consider. I cannot believe that manufacturing a car is the equivalent to releasing 2 metric tons of CO2. That is the same amount of emissions I can contribute on a daily basis. I feel guilty, but I cannot imagine my life without a car. I make sure to not drive it everyday, but I need it for work and to drive back home. Also, I’m aware that people have obsessions with collecting cars, which I now realize is a huge problem. This brings me back to the principle of minimalism. It’s important to not abuse what we have for the sake of our planet.
</p><hr>

<p>
Having a car is such a luxury. Back home so many people have to drive because of the location of where I live. Driving is such a big part of everyone’s lives. I live about 15 minutes outside of Fresno and in order to get there you have to drive. Everything is in Fresno, there isn’t really anything to do in the town that I am from. My mom and brother have to drive to school and my dad has to drive to work. However I lived down the street from the schools that I went to, so I walked to school every day. I hated walking so much because it gets tiring after a while. But now I realize that I did something for the environment and even today I am doing something. I bus to school and occasionally I bike.
</p><hr>

<p>
A typical car accounts for a quarter of an individuals carbon footprint. People might think that electric cars are a viable option however Ken addresses the issue that electric cars actually emit  more greenhouse gases than gasoline cars and are overall worse to own than a gasoline car. Recycling automobiles also doesn't even help and just creates more stuff to put in landfills, emitting more CO2. There are a billion cars on the planet and its expected to double in the next 15-20 years and the fact that we are producing more and more and not trying to create a zero emission vehicle is saddening and also drawing attention away from the cultural practice of car use. I think everyone should use public transportation and cars should be banned in the near future. Bikes would be a great option to and people would be healthier and more fit. Living in a city and walking seems like the best way of transportation to me especially considering how many cars there are in rural areas.

</p><hr>

<p>
Since taking ENGL22 last quarter, I have been really questioning whether or not I would need a car after I graduate. After this lecture, I think that the answer is no. I understand that cars can be convenient in some aspects, like being able to go somewhere at any time instead of waiting for a bus or train, but learning how harmful it is to the planet just to manufacture a car is really eye opening. I really don't mind riding the bus or train places enough to increase my carbon footprint by two metric tons from simply owning a car. Also, knowing how much money I could save by not buying a car or gas is really appealing. 
<br><br>
Ken is right; we should not be depending on technology to fix our environmental problems and we should look at the reasons why people make choices that are harmful to the planet. If people stopped buying cars and started pushing for better mass transportation infrastructure, I think more people would start catching on to how much better it is. There would be less traffic, it is not nearly as expensive as owning a car, and it is more environmentally friendly. You could make the argument that CO2 would still be emitted from buses and trains, even if they were not dependent on fossil fuels, through the manufacturing process. This is refuted by looking at how many people mass transportation could transport at once and that buses and trains are able to be fixed/upgraded without having to replace them with a new one, like you would if a car was totaled. There is no future for cars and I hope that people will come to this realization soon and be open to the benefits that not having one will bring them.
</p><hr>

<p>
As much as I agree with Ken’s propositions to transfer to a mass transit society, I see no way in our society achieving that goal. I’m sorry for being pessimistic, but with growing populations, we increasingly rely on cars every single day. People must find ways to commute to work, school, and just about anywhere without having to worry about time schedules or crowded vehicles. Carpool lanes have provided a good alternative and benefit for those who travel together since about ¾ of cars only have one person in it. The transition to all electric cars or even mass transit buses, subways, and trains would take decades. All the current used cars would have to be disposed and replaced, and there would have to be some incentive to do so. I can say that I do enjoy taking subways even in crowded places like New York, taking the train up to Santa Barbara, and biking around Isla Vista. However, not everyone is as keen on dealing with other people, the weather, or physical exercise. Cars grant the user so many options and control over their end destination. Mass transit is stationary and tied to a schedule. Ken’s lecture was certainly eye opening as I did not know that traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for young people over the age of 10. That’s quite frightening considering you never really know who’s behind the wheel of another car. I do hope that technology like Elon’s underground transport system and innovative Teslas can pave the way for future eco-friendly methods of transportation. But even if we can’t all switch to mass transit transportation, we can all at least try to drive less when we don’t have to.
</p><hr>


<p>
Ken makes a compelling arguement by explaining  how significant cars impact the environment. Cars are an everyday aspect in everyone’s lives around the world. However they are one of the top culprits to carbon emissions. Along with the fact that a simple transition from car to bike can really make a huge difference for the environment. What is said within the video also is that people may think that using a hybrid and or an electric car is very good for the environment. Though that is true, the process of making one of those cars are very horrible for the environment, it just shows a true form of capitalism. Personally, I find that isla vista is very green in their sustainable ways and makes a huge contribution by keeping this Earth sustainable.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching the video of Ken's speech, I was surprised to find that electric cars are far more harmful to nature than they are acceptable. Today, everyone is talking about electric cars and how they are the future of the planet. Everyone you talk to will agree that electric cars are useful for the planet, including me, which is why I was so shocked to find out they weren't. Although electric cars are superior to gas-powered ones, they still emit carbon dioxide to the earth. Ken notes that most Americans, but not so much by the rest of the world only recently accepted electric cars as reasonable. Auto shows are expanding rapidly around the world, and to a large extent, every country needs cars. The problem is that in these countries outside U.S. and Europe, they don't have electric cars. This will do nothing to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and we may even end up losing the battle against climate change. The answer to that question is to make vehicles cooler because they transport carbon dioxide more efficiently.
</p><hr>

<p>
Never before had I considered that the single capacity car may need to be completely removed for the sake of the planet. I had always thought that making more efficient cars would be better, but upon watching this video and understanding the amount of carbon dioxide that goes into the mere production of a car, it makes total sense. The U.S. has created such a reliance on cars and gasoline that many can’t afford to not have one. This has created a massive car culture that is not sustainable, and is spreading globally. Mass transit and carbon tax infrastructure provide the most effective solution to curb the carbon rich car lifestyle we take for granted.
</p><hr>

<p>
Cars are a major source of carbon dioxide emissions. I was shocked to learn that the average American works one day a week to buy a car. Buying a car has become very easy and more and more people can afford it. A large proportion of cars are carrying only one person. I quite agree that reducing carbon emissions by using public transport instead of driving will cause other problems as well. First of all, life is not very convenient, especially at night when you need to use a car, the bus does not operate and it is difficult to take a taxi. Secondly, cars provide people with many job opportunities, such as taxi, lyft and uber. Many people use it to support their families. If they don't use cars, many people will lose their jobs.
</p><hr>

<p>
While watching Ken's video on "Why the Climate Crisis is a Cultural Problem," I realized that I was already doing a couple of things Ken recommended were better alternatives to car use without even realizing it. Obviously, being a UCSB student requires you to walk or bike everywhere. Since I don't have a car, whenever I go somewhere outside of campus or IV I always bus there as well. Every year, drivers emit about 4.6 metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere. Most of them don't even notice how much their car really accounts for their individual carbon footprints. We should each, individually be emitting about 2 metric tons a year but cars ALONE emit more than double that amount. 
<br><br>
The number of cars in the world has quickly increased more and more each year. Learning that car ownership has gone up by 10,000% in China in just the last 30 years is quite alarming. I feel like almost every person I know owns a car back at home. People really don't realize how privileged they are to have a car. They'd rather get a car more for the purpose of showing off how much money they have to others they're surrounded by. Recently, it has been more common and normalized for parents to get their teenage kids cars. I honestly don't think every young person deserves to have a car just cause of how reckless some can be when it comes to driving, especially when they're away at school. The more people buy cars, the more greenhouse gases are emitted into their air from not only the car manufacturer but from the consumer as well, for however long they keep the car for.
</p><hr>

<p>
The whole car situation is an issue but it is also something I do not see many people switching away from any time soon. It is crazy how statistically, cars wrap around the world 31 times. The problem with getting rid of cars is just how continent it is to get around. In my household, there are nine cars parked outside my house owned by my family. I noticed that the reason for this is that we see it as a necessity but as we learn about the way cars are made is crazy because of the harm it adds to the worlds atmosphere and pollution in general. Simply to maintain a car is harmful. Even though people could get around without a car, just the idea of being a car owner makes people happy. It's the way consumerism works. Even I add to this problem as I will take a Lyft or Uber simply to not bike in the morning and that is a bad mindset to have. Now, I feel bad and have started to bike around but it took this long to change my mind, we just do not know how long others will have to take to change their mind. I also believe that the statement of those who live in the suburbs feeling they need at least two cars to get around is accurate because I live like one of those people since I am from the suburbs.
</p><hr>

<p>
One aspect that I'm not sure got mentioned here: an addiction to cars is also driving up housing prices in cities, because a lot of building codes require parking under the assumption of a car-based transportation system. This in turn makes building housing in cities significantly harder, driving up prices and making housing less affordable for everyone involved.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching this video I was very surprised that driving took such a toll on the environment. I agree with ken that this crisis may only be solved through cultural and generational change. We live in a society where the world runs on fuel and overconsumption which is in no ways great for the environment. If we don’t change the way we live, the way we were raised, then ultimately there is no hope for society against climate change. Cars are extremely bad for the environment and surprisingly enough, according to ken, even electric cars do not help. The real solution is to stop driving all together and put our resources towards public transportation which could be up to 30 times more effective. This is in fact a very radical idea because there is no possible way to stop all cars from being driven. The US holds a fourth of all the cars in the world yet only 4% of the world population. Our culture has adopted cars as a necessity of life, in which other countries such as China or India have observed and are know shifting towards. The fact of the matter is that many people may not believe that they contribute to climate change but when you are able to reflect on your past purchases and habits what you’ll find is that you contribute more than you know. It was after watching this that I’ve realized how much I actually contribute to the climate crisis just because of the social norms that previous generations have developed.

I think this class is very insightful. I've always seen electric cars as the future. However, after watching the lecture, considering everything we discussed, I think public transportation is the most environmentally safe, as well as the easier way. As prof hiltner points out, cars are expensive, dangerous and add to our carbon emissions. I agree with professor Hiltner that our cultural habits and beliefs about cars are a big problem. I think to solve this problem, we need to change the way we look at cars and make public transportation more attractive. I think the U.S. can learn from Amsterdam. There's a very big bike culture in Amsterdam, with over 300 miles of bike lanes. Amsterdam is the second largest bike-friendly city in the world, while Copenhagen is the first. It's set up to make cycling almost more efficient than driving. Given that so many americans live in rural towns and have to commute to work, this can be difficult. However, if more americans live closer to work, the culture around cars could change. I am optimistic that this "ecological culture" is changing, says prof hiltner. Personally, I see many of my friends switching to public transportation to get to and from work. I agree that technology alone will not solve the problem of climate change, but we do need to rethink the cultural practices that define much of the United States. As a society, we need to change the way we use our cars to make sense, as cars produce a larger carbon footprint than homes. I find it no surprise that in order for the economy to continue to function, large corporations and industrialization need to convince the American public to buy cars. This is at the expense of the earth. That's not surprising, given how much we've discussed in class about the role of big companies and how heavily they rely on fossil fuels. To stay in business, these companies will go to great lengths to convince everyone they need a car. I think they are now using green cars as a way to keep up the trend while still marketing to people who are worried about the planet.

<p>
After watching the two lecture videos I definitely feel silly for thinking my Toyota Prius Hybrid was saving the planet. Learning about the true cost of electric cars / zero emission cars etc. was eye opening. If we are really trying to stick to that 2 tons of emissions per year per person in order to reach our environmental goals--cars will have you 5x that or more after the day you purchase it. I didn’t realize that the manufacturing of these electric cars was so wasteful and required even more emissions than a normal car. What is even more concerning is that other countries are following suit with their obsession with cars just like America has. The more cars built, the worse off we are. 
<br><br>
Instead of focusing on the tech of cars we should have been focusing on the cultural redesign of choosing travel options other than cars--and making that cool. Additionally, cars are incredibly dangerous and even if you are a great driver yourself, the other people on the road may not be--think of teenage boys who just got their licenses (no offense). This is definitely why traffic injuries are so high. 
<br><br>
Honestly, I would not mind living in a city like Manhattan where I could walk (get more exercise!), use mass transportation (fun, cheap, and easy), or bike (like UCSB!). I hope others feel the same.

I like your positivity in this comment. I was also unaware of the environmental impacts of electric car manufacturing. I feel like much of the advertisement on electric cars exaggerates the eco friendliness of the car. I would much rather appreciate electric public transportation over personal automobiles which feed into our mass consumption culture. But I caution the criticism of cars because, environmentally friendly or not, they have improved the way we travel to a level where its efficiency is arguably worth more than any of its impacts. As we progress into an eco-friendly and self sustainable world, the approach should be to adapt rather than to eliminate. People will not give up the current modes of transportation and go back to riding horse powered chariots to save the planet. But if car manufacturing is so harmful in producing a seemingly beneficial product for the environment, then the focus should be on improving the way they are manufactured so that it becomes safe for the planet.

Until watching this video, I believed that electric cars were one of the biggest solutions to our problems. Now, I see that this is not the case (though it is helpful) it is not the ultimate solution and we need to get rid of them and change the way we look at cars. With the number of cars that are produced every year, on the road and the push to get them, it definitely would be a cultural challenge to shift away from. It is something that we must do because it will benefit everyone on the planet in the long run. 
<br><br>
As Ken mentioned, living in a city would be the best alternative and approach to mitigating the usages of cars because we could use just public transit to get where we need to go. I love taking the bus! Though it is frustrating having to wait for the bus to arrive on time and sometimes not getting a seat, it is quite an experience. I have seen conversations on a bus ride back home where two complete strangers sparked a conversation, exchanged Instagrams, and probably became friends with each other. It all began with a compliment. Not only would riding the bus be great for the environment, I feel like it can be another way to learn your way around the city or town you live in because you have to know your stop. You will also get to know the people in your town if you ride the bus enough because you will probably see the same people whenever you’re riding the bus.
<br><br>
I want to live in a city when I graduate from college, so I will not have a problem moving away from a big house. I can already imagine myself in an apartment with my partner and a dog (and children?) Maybe, I do not know, I just know I will love where I live and make it beautiful. Perhaps if there were cars that were manufactured without any emissions and did not produce any emissions while in usage, I feel like our world would be more connected because we would be forced to come together.

In agreement, I used to also believe the development of electric cars was one of the biggest and greatest solutions lately to the climate crisis, when in reality it also contributes its own form of damage. I had never ridden a bus in the United States until I came to UCSB because I was accustomed to walking or usually driving everywhere back home, but like you said, bus rides can really bring some memorable experiences, aside from a good transportation alternative. So not only does it benefit the transportation issue's role in the climate crisis, but it may even benefit us all socially as individuals and as a whole. 
<br><br>
I definitely believe that we are going to have to change certain aspects in regard to how we live in order to positively respond to the climate crisis. Technological innovations may provide some substitutions and alternatives for many of the things our society appears to be accustomed and addicted to, but it won't be enough. If we don't make actual changes, big and small, then we can't expect to see any positivity in our future, we can't expect to see a future at all realistically.

As a person who is considering buying a car, I was moved after watching this lecture. I have never thought that cars can emit so much greenhouse gas, which is the cause of climate crisis. Through previous lecture, I notice that climate crisis is a time-delay problem. I’m not willing to see me in the future and my children to suffer from the climate crisis. I would like to act from now to stop, or at least assuage, this urgent problem.
<br><br>
I was shocked by the statistics given in the lecture. Assuming that each car emits 22 metric tons of CO2 or equivalent gasses, with average lifespan of 11 years, then each car emits two metric tons of greenhouse gas per year. In other words, if one buys car every 11 year and doesn’t drive it, he/she will use up CO2 for his/her whole life. Moreover, it’s surprising that manufacturing an electric car produces 15-68% more greenhouse gas emissions than a similar gasoline car, as I used to think electric cars are totally zero-emission vehicles without considering its manufacturing process.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, it’s difficult to reduce the use of car in modern days because we have already cultivated a culture that cars are cool in US. Thus, in order to reduce cars, it’s a culture re-engineering process, instead of technology challenge. Obviously, it’s harder for people to accept a new culture than inventing a zero-emission car. Despite its difficulty, we still need to try our best to buy and drive cars as less as we can for ensuring an attainable planet for both ourselves and our children.

I too am a person considering purchasing a vehicle in the near future, but watching videos like this one have swayed me in a way. I kind of had a concept of how much cars pollute our air, but this video clarified that concept more for me. However, I am not shocked by the amount it truly is because if you consider how much goes into the manufacturing of not only the car but the parts of the car, and the tools required to make the parts of the car, the impact adds up quickly. Even though I would like a car, because I know I'm not the only one who thinks cars are "cool," and have always had the picture of my dream car in my head, I know that it's a problematic thing. I wish we lived in a country with better public transportation, because I truly feel as though in any place other than LA, SF, and places that generally have good public transportation systems, we absolutely need a car to get around and do the things we need to do. Personally, back home I live in an area where the nearest grocery store is at least 5 miles away from my house, and during winter or summer we have extreme temperatures so traveling that distance by foot, bike, or skateboard would be out of the question. It's also an area where public transportation just doesn't feel safe because there are a lot of unstable drug addicts who frequent the public bussing system. Most of us just wouldn't feel particularly comfortable on one in my area. Maybe in richer, less crime ridden areas we would be very comfortable on a bus, like in IV for example, but In the poorer cities with high crime rates, its pretty out of the question for the majority of us, especially at night. That's not to say I don't think public transportation is a bad idea, I just believe its not likely to work for everyone if we still have problems with crime and poverty and substance abusers. If we had a better, safer public transit system where I lived I would totally be fine with using it instead of a car, but for now I could not see myself being able to survive without being able to use a car in any area without good transportation systems. I feel we need to work on creating better public transportation systems in areas that do have these issues in order to be able to wean away from cars and such.

Transportation is one of the most prominent sources of carbon dioxide. In the US, many young people by the cars just because it is very cool. Although, there is a huge burden of cars, people still buy them. In America, every family has two cars, one for work, and another for driving around. This life style is not environmental friendly. Actually we can reduce the emission of carbon dioxide by taking bus, train or subway. The public transportation can largely reduce the emission of carbon dioxide. In china, many people take subway to work. If they drive cars, the congestion will cause them to be late. Besides this benefit, the less emission of carbon dioxide cannot be ignored. I think people should try to use the public transportation. And America can build more public transportation, because the network of transportation in the US is not so expanding.
</p><hr>

<p>
I really liked this episode and thought that it was awesome that Ken brought up all these different facts and impacts of cars. though, I already knew most of these facts being an ES major. I personally love owning a car. I don't see most of Americans getting rid of their car anytime soon. Not to be pessimistic, but that's just the facts. I do drive less than a few years ago and own a used hybrid. Ken forgot to mention that carpooling has a huge affect on emissions and traffic. If every car had two people, or better yet four or five people, we would only need a fraction of the cars we have today. For city goes and people that work at home or close to home to commute by public transit or bicycle, they don't even need a car. But some people commute long distances that you simply can't get to using public transit. Don't get me wrong, I am totally for having way less cars in the US, but I simply love having the freedom to go to the mountains or explore the back country where and when I want. There is no public transit that could get me back there... I think that cars should not even be allowed in cities and that mass transit, walking, and biking are perfectly acceptable ways of transportation.

I also try to use buses, subways, and bikes more frequently. I used to thinking that a car is convenient and comfortable for me to use, and I really want to buy my own car as I get my driver license. However, as I consider deeply about buying a car, it will not only increase expense of my life, but also damage environment. I am now studying in Goleta, and there are less cars as compared with some big cities, so the air quality and average temperature is great for people. However, when I stayed in China, there are many cars in one city, so the air quality becomes really bad and average temperature increases due to increase amount of carbon dioxide. From this perspective, I give up the thought of buying my own car and choose to take bus to go to school.

Although I agree that electric cars can also be very harmful. I think It's a good start that we have taken. I understand that technology is advancing and I feel like everyone is just trying to get rid of the climate crisis with more and more advanced technology. The problem about this is that I feel that no matter how much our technology advances, nature will overall win the bigger battle. I don't think anything can stop nature. This is a clear example of how everyone is so stubborn and rather than changing the cultural traditions, they rather from the problem and try to solve it by using technology. I don't think all technology is harmful, like buses, solar panels, etc. Thinking more about how us trying to seem more "cool" by not taking public transportation and rather taking cars is mind boggling.  This is a clear example how industries are the ones in control and how they manipulate us, h=the public, into buying their products. All they care about is money and never look twice even when they know that they are harming the environment.

I found this lecture video really eye opening. I had always thought that electric cars could be a viable solution to the excess emissions that most vehicles produce. The point about the fact that we are forced to buy a new car every 11 years, thus producing many tons of emissions in the manufacturing process, really stood out to me. We are trapped in the automobile industry's scheme to continue to support the economy while disregarding the impacts of our consumerism and car use. It seems like there was on opportunity after WWII for America to move in the direction of public transportation but due to politicians and industries desire to boost the economy, cars became the norm for transportation. Although technological advances, like electric cars, may help in small ways to reduce the problem we as a society need to readjust the way we think about and use cars if we want to protect the environment.

The statistic that US cars placed end to end would circle the Earth 31 times hit me very hard. I had to go back and re-listen, as it is hard to fathom what that really means. As I and my peers have never seen the actual enormous size of the Earth, its easy to pass over that statistic easily. Many people hear statistics like this and just pass over it because it can be so hard to picture. I wish the statistic were more like how many cars there were per square mile in the US or something, so someone could look around them and picture what it would be like to have that many cars in their area. I did the math and with 3.8 million sq mi in the US and 272 million cars, thats 71 cars in every sq mi in the US. This is easier for me to picture, as I can see the cars covering the entirety of the US.

The first thing that coms to mind after watching this is that I am thankful I go to UCSB and bike culture is huge. It also makes me excited to be abroad in Copenhagen, where bike culture is also widely used. But besides those moments of excitement, this video actually frustrated me a little. The hard truth is that America is built on capitalism. And while UCSB is filled with liberal environmental activists willing to make sacrifices for the planet, a lot of America rejects that idea. In my ideal world of course everyone would be using public transportation and minimizing their environmental impact. As an environmental science major, that would be a dream for me because all I want to help do is save the planet. But Ken is being very radical, and what I am willing to accept is not what the rest of the country or world is. He talks about how the social sciences needs to look into why we still drive cars, but I think that answer is incredibly clear. Cars are a status symbol in America and have been for years. Even people who want to make a difference are not going to be willing to drop their car unless they're incredibly radical. This is an unrealistic expectation for most Americans and I fear it would turn people away from the environmental movement who are afraid of giving up such big parts of their lifestyle. We need baby steps first.

I do not know whether you have noticed, but one advantage of cars is that it is more direct than trains, subways, and buses. For example, if I want to go to Campbell Hall and I live in Hollister, or maybe a bit farther. I can either take 28 or 11 bus daily at 7 o'clock and have a walk in the blisteringly cold wind, or I can jump in my comfy car and park right across the Campbell Hall. It is a hard choice for me facing commutation, let alone traveling a decent amount of distance such as to Los Angeles. Plus, some countries or cities do not even have more efficient transportation such as subways, the best plan for a white-collar traveling from the city west to east is to buy a car.

Looking at the climate crisis as a cultural problem can definitely lead to some insights as to why carbon input in America is so high (such as analyzing how our culture promotes cars as being a convenience thing). It definitely makes sense; we are raised to perceive cars as something of convenience, as a result of our emphasis of proper time management. We truly live in a society. If we lived in one that painted cars as unfavorable, one that expressed the horrible carbon emissions that they emit, or the threats of dangers that they posed, then the climate crisis would definitely be in a different state than what it is now. However, I do not know if this part of our culture can be changed. Cars are so ingrained within society that it would be nearly impossible to convince people to change how they use them. For example, what would we do with all of the cars that already exist? People would definitely not just destroy them; they would have to sell them to someone else, but the car would still be in existence. It's a hard line to cross, but I do not think it is realistic for Americans at this point.

After watching the video, I understand "why the climate crisis is a cultural problem". I thought electric cars reduce the emission of CO2 gas which helps to solve the climate crisis. Now I find I was wrong. The video tells me the fact that “a manufactured car is already equivalent to releasing two metric tons of CO2.” Even manufacturing an electric car produces two metric tons of CO2 which the amount of emission a person release a year. It is impossible to reach the aim in these years technologically on these "zero-emission" cars. I find an interesting fact in the video that the amount of vehicles in US is greater than number of people who have the driving licenses. It causes the problem of climate change more serious. As a result, we need to promote to people do not buy more cars. I understand this is a cultural problem because people always think cars are nice. The impression of cars has been built for many years, and now car's companies still made a lot of ads to promote their new cars to attract customers to buy them. In order to reduce the emissions released by cars, we need to change people's thought about cars from "cars are nice" to "cars are unnecessary". It is a tough work because changing one's lasting concept is not an easy thing. Firstly I think we need to make people understand "cars are unnecessary", public transportations such as buses and trains can replace the role of a private car. In large cities, public transportation is convenient. For example, I took subways 90% of time in Shanghai because it is very convenient and it reaches every corner of the city. My family never drives to other cities out of Shanghai. They take high-speed trains instead. These trains are even more efficient than self-driving. However, my impression of public transportation in US is not good. I went to high school in Connecticut. I felt hard to get to one place without having a car. The place I live does not have train and bus, so transportation was a tough problem for me. Even in Santa Barbara, I still have this difficulty. Now I am going to get my driving licenses because I think my life will be more convenient if I am my own car. Because of the large continent and low density of population, US does not have a mutual public transportation network which reaches every part area. Except for large cities like NYC, the transportation in other places is not convenient as having a private car. I think it is not only a cultural problem, but buying a car is a choice which people made. Instead of persuading them try not to drive a car, giving them a better choice on transportation is now the country needs to focus on.

I understand why cars are hazardous to our environment as they are the main polluters to our planet. Ideally, everyone would choose to take public transportation, ride bikes, or walk rather than drive their own individual car to wherever their destination is. However, I find this to be a little unrealistic for a few reasons. Americans are lazy and everyone knows that. We like to get to our destinations fast and efficiently. For many people the fastest and most convenient way to get somewhere is by driving their own car. Public transportation is a great option but it does take a little bit longer than if you were to drive yourself due to the multiple stops the bus must take to pick up and drop off multiple passengers. Bike riding and walking are also a good option as a person can exercise while commuting but they do take quite a bit longer depending on where it is you are going. Another thing that Ken mentioned that caught my attention was the fact that owning a car is a "cool" and "popular" thing to have, and he is right. I (and I am sure many others can relate to this) was so excited when I got my first car after receiving my license. Getting your first car is a really big deal for a lot of Americans, it is a sort of milestone in ones life. So I can see how it would be hard getting over that "cool" factor if we were to try to stray away from cars. I do think that collectively we need make an effort to save the planet and cars is one of the things that we must tackle it is just going to take a little more effort.

I think defeating the idea that we need cars and popularizing that cars are not cool will shift our generation into traveling by mass transit. I feel as though the eco-culture Ken talked about in his video is arising in Isla Vista/UCSB. Everyone at UCSB bikes, skates, or walks to class and that is the norm. UCSB is a really nice size campus because biking, skating and walking all seem super doable and are an effective way of getting around campus. Driving to class is looked down upon and often times more trouble than biking, skating or walking. I’ve heard of people driving to the library or to campbell and others responding in a shocked or confused way. I’ve also had times where I’ve heard people sound ashamed of driving places due to its close vicinity. It makes me happy to hear that UCSB has in a way embraced eco-culture. 
<br><br>
On the other hand, when places are out of biking reach or quite far people who have cars will usually offer to drive. It is an assumption that if we are going, for example, to LA for a concert, that we are going to drive. Or if my friends and I are going to downtown Santa Barbara we will often drive because one of us has a car. This assumption is the scariest to me. I think the big issue is mass transit. Although buses are an alternative to driving people often write them off as too much work/not as convenient as driving. If buses were more convenient, simpler, and quicker then it is my guess that people would be more likely to take the bus rather than drive. For example, when I lived in England taking the train to London was the norm. Driving to London could take twice as long, if not longer than that and the traffic was agonizing. The trains in England were comfortable, on time, and extremely simple to use. The tube in London was also such a great alternative to driving and as a high schooler I was able to navigate London on my own. New York City is quite different. I have lived near New York City for the majority of my life and I have barely gone to the city due to the expensive train tickets to go from my suburban town to the city and additionally the confusion of the subway. England’s mass transit was overall much more user friendly and well done compared to New York/ New Jersey’s and it shows the importance of good mass transit.

Before watching this video, I thought an electric car might be a better option than a regular car, but the truth is the production of the vehicle would be more harmful to the environment. It is sad to know even if we buy a car and never use it, the amount of CO2 we contribute is already reached the maximum. Instead, A better way to reduce the CO2 we produce is to take more public transportation, like buses and trains. However, this may seem continually reducing in recent year, and even myself failed to do it.
<br><br>
I think one of the reasons that cars are more popular than buses is the film and media advertisement made for vehicles. The ad of the car often associates with wealth, efficiency, and convenience. Nowadays, rich people will buy many cars they don’t need to use, as part of their collection. The vehicle is not merely as a way to transport, but a symbol of wealth and status. The only way is to make some changes is to let people be aware of the meaning of material goods and be honest to themselves.

Yes, the fact that electronic car can actually not contribute to reduce the carbon emission is quite surprising, since we all be instilled by the ads that e-cars using no fossil fuel but only electricity are way more environmentally friendly. The point you mention as the ads constantly tell us if you want a perfect life, you have to own a car is also clear to see. Only in the progress of one car production, there will be 22 metric tons of CO2 emitted, not to mention the amount of released gases when we actually use it. And what we can do, as a college student, is to take public transportations like bus as more as possible for its convenience and of course for its less emission than private cars have.

This video is what makes me pessimistic about the outlook of climate change and the planet. I find it extremely hard to believe that people will ever be willing to give up cars. I personally absolutely love driving. I love the feeling of freedom and independence I get by driving myself around without the help from others. I love that I can go anywhere I want in the nation anytime I want. Obviously I don't go all around the country, but knowing that I can feels good. Now I am definitely willing to give this up to help slow the climate crisis, but I do not think many other people will. In our society, the ability to drive yourself is seen how I personally see it, as a representation of freedom and independence. I don't think people will ever like the idea of being driven around by someone else in a crowded bus or train. I think it makes people feel vulnerable. They have to trust the driver, along with the rest of the passengers. Our society teaches us that independence is cool, so that is what most people believe. Obviously this needs to change, but how do we go from that idea to the total opposite? We need to get people to have the mindset that it is totally fine, even healthy, to rely on other people, but how do we do that after years of promoting freedom and independence?

When I was younger, I hadn’t ever really heard or seen much electric cars in the town I grew up in. However, they have become a more common thing to see now. I always thought that electric cars were better for the planet because the only way I have ever seen them advertised as is to be environmentally friendly. It was shocking when Ken states that electric cars actually generate more greenhouse cases when manufactured in comparison to gas cars. The stat of “15 to 68 more greenhouse gases” was news to me. I would have never expected this to be a reality of the production of electric cars, I always assumed everything about the vehicle was environmentally friendly. While these vehicles have become more practical and affordable, it doesn’t mean it is accessible to everyone. While many would love to lower the amount of CO2 they put out, sometimes it is not the simplest option for them to go out and buy an electric car. Yes, electric cars might overall be better for the environment, but it is not the only option. Public transportation can also be another great option. Also, I wasn’t aware about how many metric tons of CO2 are emitted annually by cars. Ken mentions how 4.5 metric tons of CO2 per car are emitted. This is alarming to say the least, especially when it should be limited to no more than 2 metric tons. Being provided with this information makes me think about the times I have used my car for unnecessary trips or just randomly driving around. Before, I didn’t ever consider how harmful my actions could be, but now through this course, it is something I do on a daily basis.

A terrifying fact mentioned in the video is how the United States only has 4% of the world’s population but taking only a quarter of our cars and lining them up from end to end would circle the Earth 31 times. This is way too excessive and impractical and I think most people can agree that we don’t need that many cars. I think what’s stopping us from transitioning from cars to public transportation is money. Why would they make it easier and cheaper for consumers to transport themselves when industries can make money from car sells, insurance, and gasoline. If we really want to keep within a 1.5 to 2 degree temperature rise we have to eliminate cars there is no other option as Ken mentioned our entire allotted 2 metric tons of CO2 would go directly to owning a vehicle not even taking into account actually using it. This is such a problem in itself because how do you convince people to give up their cars, a commodity they’ve been working up to something that is not only convenient but serves as a social distinction. Myself included, would find it difficult to give up my car even with knowing all that I know.

This video truly made me reflect on my ecological footprint simply from owning a car. As Professor Hiltner mentions in this video, the carbon footprint a person leaves behind by owning a car is huge, without even taking into consideration food, clothes, etc. The amount of carbon released by one car is insane, but the fact that all the cars in the world can be lined up and wrapped around the Earth 31 times is mind blowing and actually disgusting to think about. As a materialistic society, we are quickly digging our own graves through the overconsumption ideals we are fed every day. We are living in a capitalist economy where we are force fed advertisements and essentially brainwashed to over-consume in hopes of feeling happy or satisfied. Usually this feeling only lasts a few seconds, but the damage it creates on our planet is irreversible.
</p><hr>

<p>
Cars are a large part of our lives, as Professor Hiltner points out. Just walk out onto any street in Isla Vista and you will see this – cars are packed into the streets, and finding a parking spot is very, very difficult. In recent years, a number of individuals and institutions have been making a push for good public transportation as an alternative to cars; for example, at UCSB, freshmen are discouraged from bringing their cars, and all students can ride the bus for free while they are enrolled in school. But aside from public transportation, I was previously under the impression that electric cars were much better for the environment. But as Professor Hiltner points out, the problem with electric cars lies in their creation. The manufacturing of a car still releases large amounts of Co2 into the atmosphere. In order to reduce our Co2 intake, society as a whole needs to move more towards alternative methods of transportation, such as bikes and buses. I never really thought before this video of how making a car causes harm to the atmosphere, but rather how cars affect the world in the day to day life.

From this lecture video, I learned that Americans need to change their cultural lifestyle when it comes to cars because cars are the singlehandedly the worst way to release carbon dioxide. And sadly, cars are one of the most prized possession of every individual in this country. The manufacturing process of cars is what contributes to the massive amount of emission every year. This alarming fact tells me that technological advances should be reconsidered and improved in a much more sustainable way because many of these advances aren't helping out the environment from all the damages it is producing. The country should develop a more sustainable method in which many people can utilize in their everyday lives instead of relying on driving a vehicle that can bring so many damages to our precious planet. And I am glad Ken touched on the subject of electric cars because many people were focused and intrigued with the technological developments evident in electric cars while being blinded to the fact that the production processes were pivotal to bringing environmental damages and carbon dioxide emissions into our home. And I think it would be amazing if our country to figure out on how to improve public transportation because I believe that utilizing public transportation could be one of the best options over cars. Public transportation should be a part of the everyday lives of many people in the future because that is one of the sustainable ways to help our planet. It takes individuals to their far destinations with such a small amount of oil. Although some cities and areas in the United States don't have much developed systems of public transportation, I believe that it could work out for everyone in the future if the country can come up with ways to improve the system. I believe it is extremely important for everyone (including myself) to take note of how our wants are bringing great consequences to our planet. And we must learn how to reduce such consequences with better ways.

As an individual who has not yet had the chance to own or even drive an automobile, I can say with certainty that my shifts and views on car ownership have been shaped for the better by this lecture. Before taking this course to better my understanding of the climate crisis, I was an individual who also highly worshipped companies like Tesla with their introduction and spread of electric vehicles. I thought that this would greatly improve our world and help ultimately solve the issue of anthropogenic climate change. I even sought out to buy an electric vehicle when I had the money and driver’s license instead of a traditional car. Taking this course and especially listening to this lecture has made me realize how wrong I was in thinking that simply switching to electric vehicles would have a massive positive effect. What stood out for me from the lecture was the mere fact that even owning a car and not yet driving it already contributed two metric tons of carbon dioxide into our atmosphere. I had not taken the manufacturing process into account. Instead of finding fuel alternatives, I now advocate for diminishing the use of cars as a whole. This is something that will not be easy to achieve, as the use of cars has been so deeply ingrained into our culture and society, similar to consumerism. We must break out of this cycle and stop partaking in it just because “this is the way it has always been.”
</p><hr>

<p>
In the beginning, Ken mentions that cars account for a quarter of our individual carbon footprints thus if we want to reduce our individual footprints we should definitely deal with cars, and he introduces how electric cars do not directly emit CO2 thus reduces carbon emissions to zero. But he later reveals that sadly electric cars did not solve the problem and are more trouble than good, it actually releases more greenhouse gases than their manufacturers. We often do not consider the production process, this means that if you buy a car and never use it you might already reach the maximum amount of emission individually, this is surprising to me. I liked Ken’s idea that instead of wasting time on reengineering in the automobile, we should focus our attention on reengineering the cultural practices of car use.
</p><hr>

<p>
The automobile industry in the carbon omissions that it produces is clearly one of the most destructive on the planet. The bad news is that primarily this issue has been created by Americans and Europeans, the large groups that are responsible for the gas guzzling sedans and trucks. Americans and Europeans have participated in a standard of living that is mostly unattainable in other parts of the world. However, just because it is unsustainable in other areas of the world does not mean that the people who live Outside of the United States are not entitled to the same luxuries. We face a major issue because there are two simultaneous major factors at play. first, we must face what we did as a nation; glorifying cars and abundant cars at that, associating larger with more luxurious and accepting a totally poor use of space and materials. Not only do we have our own behavior to curb and mend, but now these usage of cars must be curbed in other parts of the world. Our irresponsible practices are unfair but luxurious. Personally wonderful and globally detrimental. We have afforded ourselves so many luxuries and entirely ignored the real life effects of that persistent need for more. Not only does the rest of the world have to feel the effects of our consumption through the horrors of climate change, but they are also denied all of the luxuries themselves that contribute to this problem. Before the ecological impacts can simmer away, social reform must be made. It must be made to encourage environmentally conscious practices, discourage destructive behavior and humble people who have become far too disillusioned for their own good.

<p>
Ken’s lecture video, “Why the climate crisis is a cultural problem (and why electric cars are more trouble than good” presented a lot of new information and viewpoints for me. I had no idea that the production of electric cars produced such an astonishing amount of carbon. I always just took it as a fact that electric and hybrid cars are waaaaaay better than ones that solely rely on gas, but I now know that I was mistaken and that I really should do more research before considering information like that as a fact. 
<br><Br>
I thought the point of people not using public transportation because it isn’t cool was a very interesting point. I personally don’t use public transportation that often when I’m at home because it’s really inconvenient. I’m from Los Angeles and from what I have experienced, our public transportation system is not that efficient, especially compared to cities like New York or London. Watching this lecture reminded me of a field trip I took to downtown Los Angeles in high school on the metro. I live about 45 minutes outside of downtown by car (on a good traffic day) and the total time from leaving my house, to getting on the metro, and finally arriving at grand central station took about two hours. I thought it was a cool experience, but if I had to go to work every day on that metro it would be very very time consuming. 
<br><Br>
I hope that when I graduate I’ll be able to live in a city where the public transportation is better, or where I can ride my bike around easily. IV made me realize how much I enjoy being out and about on my bike. Unfortunately, I will keep using a car at home since there are a lot of hills and I do not have the leg strength to ride my bike on a daily basis. I’m hopeful though that one day I won’t have to use a car.
</p><hr>

<p>
I have to be honest, I only started public transport since I got to UCSB. Before that I don’t think I ever stepped in a bus. Maybe a train once. Cars in our society are connected with freedom to go anywhere we want at any time. People view buses, trains, and subways as a hassle because you have to find the schedule of when they are coming and going and you have to sit with other people. But really thinking about it, these small inconveniences are absolutely nothing to not only the impact on the environment with how many tons of CO2 it emits through manufacturing and use, but also how much money it is(about 9,000 dollars a year). 
<br><br>
I used to live in a rural area back then so public transportation was pretty much impossible for when I had to go to work. In fact, I had to pick two of my other friends up before school because they had no other way of getting there. This is an extreme case though, in most populated zones of the US there is easy public transport(as I discovered when I first moved here and realized how easy it was to use the bus to get around). I just signed a lease for a house for next year in Isla Vista and I was already excited about being able to park my car there without spending an extra 600 dollars on parking. However, I’m second guessing myself now. Do I really want to be spending that much money as a college student on something that I don’t really need and is terrible for the environment? Not really. This goes back to the film we just watched. This was definitely my favorite lecture because it made me question my direct decisions.

Cultural changes will create more change in global warming. And this makes sense right. Changing the way people; think they need to live their lives to survive,  shifting our blame of global warming to big corporations, and  together can impact our movement towards a sustainable way, of life. This point was made back in Before the Flood with Sunita Narain in regards to the impact people have on the climate. Narain's point was regulating consumption, this a cultural change. Her example was giving the world's poor access to solar energy is not that easy by putting it in perspective of the US having yet to switch to solar. So technological advancement is not easy, particularly in the underdeveloped world. Narain particularly point at the US, for good reason too, because of their huge consumer base. The US is (or was depending on how you see things) the leading country in the worlds as far as progression goes but we have done so little compared to our carbon emissions to lead in combating environmental pollution. It was disheartening to see DeCaprio not fully believe that the US has an issue with buying more and thus leading to more pollution. You'd think that as leaders we would have done something against climate change by now but not only have we moved backwards by electing politicians that disregard the issue but now we have more citizens caring less and less about the environmental impacts of their choices due to said leadership; which sets the wrong example to other countries.
<br><br>
To answer Ken's question, I think if the whole car industry is not addressed with harsh restrictions and no other solutions to innovative yet environmentally conscious solutions are made to replace the car, the car will not change and will continue to be a staple of our inability to change with the times.

As Ken started to talk about the negative effects of electric cars, it made me realize that sometimes based on what the media says about something I’ll choose to believe it without researching it. Up until now, I had naively thought that electric cars were good for the environment. That they would help lessen the amount of CO2. However, Ken has made me realize that production of an electric car emits a lot of greenhouse. This shows how industries will make us, the consumers, believe one thing about their products in order to keep us purchasing their products. They’re not transparent about the effects all their products have on the environment. Even though learning about the negative effects of electric cars, this only helps reinforce the idea that using public transportation is the best option. I personally feel that UCSB makes it convenient to use public transportation instead of bringing your own car from home. Back home I wouldn’t even consider taking public transportation because it always felt unreliable. This shows how a lot of different cities in California have a large disparity in how effective their transportation systems are. If they were consistently effective throughout the state then I personally feel that Californians would be more inclined to use public transportation. In order to decrease the usage of cars, I feel California would also have to implement transportation that carries individuals long distances. This is mainly due to many people have jobs that are an hour or so away from where they live.

After watching Professor Ken’s lecture video, I was left surprised. Like many people, this whole time I was believing in the idea that electric cars were the best way to go in order to cut down on our greenhouse gas emissions. I mean even Tesla’s mission statement is “Zero Emissions”. What I didn’t realize until after this video was that producing them creates more problems and defeats this zero emissions statement. 
<br><br>
So then what is actually the best way to come about this serious problem? As mentioned in the video, I agree that trains and buses should be made more popular among society. I find it crazy that if all the cars in the U.S. we’re lined up end to end, they would wrap around Earth 31 times! This was the point where I realized how big of an issue it really is, leading me to to conclude that other, more environmentally friendly, transportation should be promoted ASAP. Promoting this way of daily living will be difficult as we’re all use to the luxury of our cars, but what people need to realize is that they have the biggest luxury of all, living on this planet, so they should never take it for granted. If we all come together to advocate for better strategies to fight this complex issue, we can continue to enjoy this grand luxury we are so lucky have.
</p><hr>

<p>
I had a vague idea how the production costs of cars were expensive, but I was not aware of how much CO2 is emitted during the process of creating even electric cars. After learning this, I’m not sure what could be a viable solution to decrease the amount of emissions coming from cars. The industry has a firm grip over travel over the entire world, and with infrastructure being built with car usage in mind, there doesn’t seem to be a way to completely remove them from use. It’s saddening to see how the production of an electric car is equal to an entire human’s lifespan of carbon emissions, and with an increasing amount of importance placed on showing off material luxuries like cars, it’s also hard to see a viable solution being created. The only one I can think of is incorporating an efficient public transport system like the bullet trains in Japan, but even then I’m not sure how much effort and work that would take especially across a landmass like the United States.

Cars have made a great impact on our lives. Our world is mostly run by cars and many of us rely too much on our car for anything like going to work, school or a simple errand. Our cars have become something we value immensely and are portrayed as a necessity for transportation almost everywhere, therefore it will be extremely hard for us to give up our car. When we have the possession of a car we feel like we have so much freedom that we can go anywhere we want at any time we want but this underlies the fact that we are releasing harmful CO2 gases every time we drive a car. The average teenager today either has their own car or really wants one because of the benefits a car gives you, freedom, convenience, and a cool image.  This as consequence makes it extremely difficult for us to let go of our cars because we are lazy and we choose the path that is easier and more convenient for us but we don't realize that this choice is harming the entire nation. A simple decision as to driving to school that is a block away from you, driving yourself to a destination instead of carpooling, or owning multiple cars when you only need one, all affect our carbon footprint. I understand that today's world is designed for having a car because many places are relatively far to walk but we can still put in some effort to emit less CO2. Taking small steps like carpooling once in a while or taking the bus when you have the time will drastically help in decreasing harmful gases. Overall, cars play a huge role in our society and suddenly switching to having no car will almost be impossible for some people but with small steps and finding alternatives for transportation will definitely help our environment.

I definitely don’t think that cars are a necessary part of life to function in American society. When I was younger my parent lost their license, and so my family spent several years without either a car or a driver. Even in a small town, this was far from impossible to deal with, although at times admittedly very inconvenient. However, if we made a large scale cultural shift to move away from cars, this inconvenience wouldn’t be a problem.
<br><br>
I think it’s really great that biking and public transit are such popular forms of transportation at UCSB. If more cities implemented bike paths like our campus has, then it would be much easier to convince people to adopt biking as a stable mode of transit. Most UCSB students probably don’t have a car with them at school, likely due to the expense of buying, maintaining, and parking a car; these problems, for many, outweigh the benefits of having a car here. The question then becomes: how can we convince the rest of the US that having a car is more trouble than it’s worth? What social changes can we make so that the cost of owning a car outweighs the benefits, not just in the eyes of college students but of society at large? Though it would initially be expensive to set the foundations for this cultural shift in transportation (new bike paths, increased bus access, etc.), the effects would be immensely positive in regards to our environmental impact.

I have not felt more guilty about driving than I do right now but in a good way. A way that’s needed. I loved that Ken was able to appreciate the effort companies are putting in to develop cars that release less emission but how he was able to still critique and mention that this is not the answer to our problems. In a society where everything is about popularity and what’s “in” I loved that Ken saw that right now that is one of our biggest hopes. If communal transportation can truly be popularized then maybe we have a chance at saving our planet and slowing down the damage we’ve caused so far. 
<br><br>
His fact about how the U.S has more cars than it does actual licensed drivers, astounded and angered me. It reminded me of how the film “Minimalism” pointed out how materialistic we really are. What need do we have to have more than one or two cars especially if it’s only one of us using it. I think that because it’s only one of us, it is the absolute best time to use public transportation, but as this lecture video and Ken pointed out, public transportation has been deemed as “uncool” and therefore not used the amount it should be.
<br><br>
This made me so aware of how I drive my car even to nearby places simply because it is convenient for me when I could very easily walk or bike that same distance that would have no repercussions on our atmosphere. I wonder just how much we could do if every person in the population took public transportation or walked to their destinations for one day out of the week. I can truthfully say that I’ll be changing my transportation habits for the better.
</p><hr>

I have always seen comments on threads regarding climate crisis and topics alike where someone will mention how electric cars such as Teslas aren't completely good for the environment . Ken has helped me realize why this is, expanding on the topic of electric vehicles. I found it fascinating at the staggering amount that CO2 is released during production of one car. Nevertheless, an electric car is still a better option than a fossil fuel one. 
<br><br>
I have always supported Elon Musk in his endeavors, and still do after this video. He is still trying to help in some way that he can, more than many many other people. The new challenge is to make public transportation look cool, as Ken stated. In today's society, you're considered "lame" if you don't have a car. For example, in the dating scene, one person would pick up their date with their car to go to their destination. Failure in having a car makes things complicated. There has also been a spike of car usage for burn outs, donuts, and drag racing. This ever increasing car culture is only worsening the climate crisis.
</p><hr>

<p>
I always thought moving to electric vehicles was the next step. I did not think about cars that being manufactured. The actual process to make cars contributes to carbon emissions and that is not a good thing. Public transportation is definitely the best way but it won't be achieved in a short timeframe. Good thing we have a city like New York to look at. People in New York rarely drive, all they use are trains to get to their destination. These days, people look down on public transportation and we have to change that. I think that starts with making public transportation free. I think from there, people will use trains and buses on a regular basis.

It is shocking to learn that electric cars are actually bringing more environmental problems to society. Because for a lot years, electric cars are considered as the solution to end the pollution done by using fossil fuels and the electric cars are becoming more and more affordable and convenient. In order to reach the goal of slowing down the global warming process, each person is assigned a certain limited amount of carbon emissions, or we will fail to reach the goal. Although the electric cars seem to be very eco friendly, the worst part is the manufacturing that in the process of producing one electric car is releasing more greenhouse gases than producing SUVs and small cars. According to the calculation, even people just buy the car and park there without driving, we will still release more co2 than we should. Professor states that it is almost impossible to make a car with 0 carbon emission from the time of producing it to eleven years later when it is the end of the car’s life. 
<br><br>
From this lecture, I learn that technology is changing our society, and many people are trying to use technology to solve the environmental problems. But we cannot just solely rely on the technology, because it may come with side effects that we normally will not consider, such as the carbon emission of producing the electric car. It is still very important to let people realize the climate crisis and let everyone make some changes in their daily life.
</p><hr>

<p>
The solution isn't in electric cars as it's still a car which in its process of manufacturing it there are carbon emissions and it still contributes to being part of traffic and noise pollution. Having a car contributes so much to one's carbon footprint, so it's best to look into using public transportation. The reason why I feel like it's looked down upon to use public transportation is because of there being status with having a car and a preference for having privacy and in a sense, people seek acceptance and with having a car that can happen. And cars have negative effects besides environmental ones as they are quite expensive, so paying for one takes time as not everyone can pay the full price at the dealership; also cars have their expenses with there being the need to pay for gas and upkeep fees, like needing to go to the mechanic. People are influenced by their peers and succumb to peer pressure all the time, not just when it comes to partaking in alcohol or drugs. Cars have negatively impacted the environment and will continue to do so, but it's so deeply ingrained in American culture that it's hard to break the tie because it's not like life without cars will become impossible as there are many nations where the common mode of transportation is the train and people are just fine. The only way to fix this issue is to have the government get involved as they're the ones who allocate funding to the transportation department, but the other issue that arises is what to do with the roads. It's crazy how advertisers and some officials try to coerce into thinking they have solutions (electric cars) when in reality it's just more problems.

Watching this lecture make me realize the transportation accounts for a quarter of the CO2 emissions and it’s necessary to change people’s transportation way to take the public transportation like bus or metro since we should hold the average person CO2 emission less than 2 metric tons every year so that we can keep the global temperature rising below 2 degrees celsius. Electronic automobiles is also considered as a solution to the environmental problem. So it makes me shocked when i saw that electronic car production will produce 15 and 68 percent more green house gases than a similar gasoline car. This make feel like there’s actually no such real solution to reduce the co2 emission to zero. We can only reduce the co2 emission by changing our transportation way. However, cars are actually very important in America especially California because of the scattered buildings and immature public transportation system. We can also choose to share car with people who have close destination though. And take more public transportation.

Carbon Footprints are interesting in a good and a bad way. I first learned what they were in high school from my buddies environmental science class. They had to do some weird project analyzing the footprints of specific countries. I didn't understand back then that each and every person has their own carbon footprint. While I was watching this video I was reminded of certain cars that are just monstrosities to the environment. Hummers are simply awful beasts and it is insane how bad cars like that are for the climate. It is honestly very sad knowing that the whole belief that electric cars are the 100 percent solution is actually quite flawed. To make these cars, the process emits detrimental amounts of CO2 and is in fact not as great and the media and society builds them up to be. One thing I learned years ago, is that the electric cars are great and all but what happens when you replace the batteries. Where do those batteries go? Are the recycled and renewed? No they are corrosive acidic killers that basically sit there. There is no real way to break the batteries down efficiently.
<br><br>
There is such a negative view of public transportation. I hear so many people complain how its only for poor people and its filthy and degrading. I just cant believe that is the view of something that can benefit us so much. I once saw this image that showed about 40 cars on the road. The next image was those same 40 people but in one bus, significantly reducing traffic and care emissions. I do agree that there should be a revamp of public transport and a way to make it more savvy and tuned to modern society so that people may be more willing to actually just take public transportation instead of their own cars. I can see how giving up the comfort of ones car is hard. We become so attuned to having the ability to go anywhere whenever we want with a personal vehicle. Cars are part of most peoples lives and they are important. If people began to maybe only use their car on the weekends and commute to work using transport. Also Ken made a good point when he was talking about the money that could be saved by using public transport. It takes 9 thousand a year to keep a car and how much time is spend getting that money. I just hope more people will be willing to consider public transport as a plausible and good change.

The amount of carbon emission the production of a car makes is insane. This whole video showed me over and over again how harmful the daily usage of an automobile can be. Living in I.V. and being a broke college student has taught me that although it is convenient to travel in a car, it is also extremely easy and manageable to use public transportation and ride a bike to get to places. Ever since I moved to Santa Barbara, I have been on a car about five times each quarter, and I do not feel like I'm missing out on anything important. After watching this video, however, I wish I could convince everyone else to do it as well.
<br><br>
I think the best solution would be to improve public transportation in all countries; for example, Japan's public transportation is amongst the best. It has trains that will take you through Japan in such a small amount of time. Many people prefer to have a car because it is so convenient and a fast way to get to your intended location, but if the same outcome was offered at a more sustainable cost, many more people would be persuaded to change. Supply will always meet demand, if more people begin to demand better public transportation, it will be delivered.

This video was shocking and eye-opening to the damage cars do to the environment.  I thought I was massively reducing my carbon footprint when I saved up to buy an eco-friendly car, but after watching this video it shows how little that actually does compare the massive amounts of CO2 it took to make the car.  It is almost scary how many cars we have on this planet like I am not surprised, but the amount being able to wrap around the earth 31 times is staggering.  What makes that figure even more frightening is the massive amounts of CO2 that are put into the air for every single car manufactured.  When Ken said if you take the cars you buy over your lifetime and leave them in your driveway, parked, you would have used up all the CO2 emissions you allowed in your life to maintain a healthy planet.  This woke me up I never even thought about the amount CO2 that goes into to making a car just driving it.  I feel guilty thinking about how much I used to drive my car back home.  I would go for drives for hours long for no real reason or drive unnecessarily far to get food just for the ride with my boys.  I was thinking the whole time that it kind of evens out because I have a car with "good" gas mileage and " hey at least I am not like this other guy who drives a truck that gets 10 miles per gallon".  This video woke me up to what I am truly doing by riding around so much.  I aim to ride my bike as much as I can and not use cars for walkable or bikeable journeys.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching this video, I am very surprised to learn that electric cars are not as good for the environment as they are advertised. I sort of thought that we were finally making some progress towards lowering our carbon emissions as a whole with more electric cars on the road but nope, still bad! One thought I had while watching this video is if we were to add subways to more cities to use less cars, would building and using the subway still be more eco friendly after all the emissions that are made while building it? How long would it take to balance out the emissions of building and using the subway compared to using a car? I also agree with Ken in the fact that I think many people don't take the bus because its not necessarily the "cool" thing to do which is kind of sad. I also think that more people would buy electric cars if they were to be made cheaper than regular cars. Like if a Tesla was cheaper than my Nissan, I would be way more likely to purchase an electric car. Also, if you think about, for example, a college student in Isla Vista buying an electric car, where would they charge it? Street parking is already hard enough here and theres not really a place to charge cars around here. I guess this kind of further proves Kens point, that we should just switch to buses and bikes more so that we won't even have that problem. Between me, my mother, my father and my step dad, we have 9 cars total. NINE! While 5 of them are more than 10 and some more than 20 years old, I still find this pretty ridiculous and I have never really put this into perspective. Theres no need for this many cars in my family, most of them just sit in the driveway anyways, so why buy them in the first place? It's because they are "collectors items" and they are once again, a trend. The climate crisis really is a cultural problem and this lecture has really opened my eyes about just how large of a carbon foot print I have.
</p><hr>

<p>
Before watching this video I thought a big step in saving the environment was fully transitioning into all electric vehicles. I never realized the effect of the making of the actual car coming into play in carbon emissions. Car use is a big issue that I learned from this video. A big way to solve this car use is public transportation. A better infrastructure needs to be put into place. If everyone had electric cars but they still each had individual cars we'd be back at square one. I think a major issue that needs to be addressed is the stigma with public transportation. There's this big idea of it being “gross” and “unsafe.” Which to a certain degree is true. There is a major attitude shift that comes with taking public transportation that tends to lead people to treating it worse than they would their own transportation. It's a vicious cycle that needs to stop with proper cleaning and protection of public transportation. It also needs to be more accessible. In other countries they are in all parts while in America large portions are neglected. I personally have no issue with public transportation and will continue using it whenever possible and hope more people do so too.
</p><hr>

<p>
This was a very informative video statistics wise because I learned how simply owning a car without driving it takes up one's recommended carbon footprint for life and just how efficient public transportation is. Trains, subways, and buses are 30, 20, and 14, respectively, times more efficient than cars but only 5% of Americans use them. What I think regarding this is that public transportation should be revamped and modeled after other cities and countries with successful public transportation. The East Asian countries have some of the most efficient subways in the world with a majority of the population using them. This is due to a combination of clean and reliable public transportation with a culture of people using public transportation. Changing culture will take time but I think that big cities should implement changes to make public transportation cleaner to make it more desirable and eventually change the culture. For that reason I think that places such as cities can eventually not use cars as there will be more convenient methods but for the suburbs it is hard for me to imagine a reality where cars will not be used no matter how good public transportation gets. This is because it will be hard to become more convenient than cars because of how long it takes to get around.
</p><hr>

<p>
I personally love public transportation and I hope I always will.  I come from the Bay Area where we have BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) which is a high speed heavy rail transit system that services millions of people in the Bay Area every year.  I could get almost anywhere in the Bay Area for less than $20 round trip and feel a lot less stressed about having to drive a car long distances.  I was saddened to leave the system behind when I came to attend UCSB, but was happy to embrace the Goleta/Santa Barbara bus lines as my new form of transportation.  I think in order to reduce the carbon footprint made by GHG emissions of cars, we need to improve the infrastructure and convenience of public transportation. The stigma against public transportation needs to be removed as taking the bus or train can often be a lot more convenient and climate-sensitive than driving a small car.

I always have dreamed of living in New York in the future, just so I don't have to rely on cars often to get to places where I need to go. I thought that it was unhealthy for the environment to drive them at all, yet had not even a single clue that we were causing harm by just purchasing them. When Ken ran over the statistics that stated simply just buying a car meant that you were maxed out on carbon emissions for the next 11 years, I was genuinely in shock. When I hear this, it surprises me that our planet is even still alive right now. The popularity of electric cars has increased not only because of the fact that it's better for the environment, but also is a cheaper alternative to buying gas with hiked up prices. This brings me to my next point.
<br><br>
I don't know whether cultural changes will occur before these materialistic ones. I think that even my parents moving to America was defined my materialistic milestones. First apartment, first car, first house, second car. They had dreams of owning an Audi when moving to the United States and nearly 15 years later, they achieved that goal and continue to be proud of it. Our human race in general has placed a heavy emphasis on the fact that life is defined by how much you have. There's a reason why YouTube videos where homeless people are always popular on social media, and that's because the people talking to them and donating are seen to be doing them a favor. However, if the tables were turned and life was defined by your sustainability, the majority of us college students would be at the very bottom of that list. It's going to take a very long time for us as a human generation to get there, and part of me believes that that change won't happen quickly enough. I know myself that my goals aren't going to be defined by materials, but I think that my parents' generation will continue to do so for as long as they can, since that's the way that they were brought up in their circumstances.

I agree that shifting cultural views on cars is probably going to take place after we address that our ideas of freedom that are so entangled with owning a car. The US in particular has a huge problem with materialism, and that has to be changed because it simply isn't sustainable. As Ken discussed, cars aren't really even made to last that long - currently about 11 years on average. Just like most things we use, even cars are made to be thrown away. 
<br><br>
I was drawn to your comment because you mentioned living in a city like New York; I grew up in Boston, another east coast city that does a pretty good job of providing public transport alternatives to driving. Don’t get me wrong, there were still tons of cars in the city at all times, but the T, for example, was incredibly popular due to lack of parking available. When alternatives are offered that provide solutions to people’s annoyances, they’ll usually take advantage of them.
<br><br>
All that being said, I also think it’s important to call to attention the accessibility of public transportation to all people, not just folks who can afford a car but choose not to own one. Recent rises in fares have been met with protests in NYC, which in turn has brought retaliation from the NYPD. Having watched the student fare in Boston go from $0.85 to around $2, I can attest to the anger that this injustice sparks. If we want people to use public transportation, it has to be not just available, but affordable.

While I watch this video of Ken telling us how horrible cars are, I am curious about what kind of car he drives. Does he drive at all? Does he even own a car? In no way am I placing blame, I am truly just curious. I am no saint since I drive a 1971 Volkswagen bus with 12-15MPG if I'm lucky. Not an impressive stat for an Environmental Studies major.
<br><br>
I did enjoy that Ken touched upon the psychological side of climate change and human desire. Yes, we know what we are doing, and yes, we know the consequence of it, but we do not know why. Why is human desire so great and neverending? Even the richest man will want more than he has. If there is a serious change that needs to be made in the auto industry, there needs to widespread cultural dive into the initial desire for cars over any other, less harmful method of transportation. Attending UCSB has made me think about the amount of gas I would spend every month going to and from school in my VW bus compared to my biking to class now. Not only do I feel more active, breathe fresh air, and get to enjoy the beautiful campus that I call home, but I am also doing no harm to the environment.

I think it's completely bonkers that the United States still doesn't have reliable high-speed rail transit all over the country. It's shown to be extremely effective mode of transportation if you look at the New York City Subway and rail transport in Japan. If more and more people start to use trains as their main mode of transportation, there would be less of a demand for cars, less priority on building vast parking lots, less CO2 emissions, and less monetary expense for the commuters. A speedy nationwide rail system would also be a cheaper, much more environmentally-friendly alternative to domestic flights, too. After I moved to Los Angeles from the suburbs of Chicago, one aspect of the city that I really enjoyed was the Metro buses and trains that could take me around the city for just a couple bucks. I don't have my driver's license, so getting around in the suburbs by myself without a car was extremely difficult. Before I came to LA, I was dead set on getting my license in college but I'm not sure if I even need to anymore because I have been getting around fine on public transport both in Los Angeles and in Santa Barbara. I understand that living in such big cities helps a lot, and most other places do not have adequate public transport and driving is necessary. We really need to shift our focus on bettering buses, trains, and bike lanes all around the country in order to decrease the priority of cars and mitigate the CO2 emissions that we are currently releasing.

In the long-term development of society, automobiles usually play an important role. People want to own a private car is reasonable. However, while bringing convenience to people, they have also had a serious impact on climate change. I used to think that people could solve the problem by using more electric cars, but I didn't consider that when producing electric cars, people were also making more carbon dioxide. Although these electric vehicles will still play a role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions if they are used for a long time, we have better solutions. If most people use public transportation, we cannot even produce these electric vehicles, so that the factory can reduce carbon dioxide emissions even more.

Realistically, getting rid of cars within the society of today will be extremely hard. Especially, since many people have become extremely dependent on them for everyday life and for the smallest things. However, I do believe they aren’t completely necessary, especially if more funding goes to public transport in order to efficiently and with less environmental harm travel between places and cities. It would cause a lot of people to start to walk, bike, use public transportation, and time manages a lot differently. This is what I believe would cause a negative backlash from getting rid of cars to help the environment. If more funding was placed to help create more eco-friendly methods of transportation and cater to people’s personal needs, such as going to the market or picking up a kid, then I do believe that there can be q future without cars. I do believe that the future of technology might help us find a way to more efficiently and effectually approach the climate crisis.
</p><hr>

<p>
In the video “Why the climate crisis is a cultural problem (and why electric cares are more trouble than good)”, I was frustrated by the fact that not only are Americans producing increased rates of CO2 and greenhouse gases, we are inspiring other countries around the world to do the same through our love and dedication to a society revolved around consumerism. I had realized early on through my experiences in environmental studies that much of the developed world are the ones causing many of the issues on our planet (issue brought up in environmental justice), but I hadn’t thought of it in terms of what other countries WOULD do. I believed that other people would see the harm the the US and other countries have done, and choose not to follow in their footsteps, but we have idealized and advertised this unhealthy way of living to the point where everybody wants in. The US has a lot of influence in the world, and we squander it, handing it all over to the top 1% of the wealthy in our country who use that to further expand their own wealth. I agree with what Ken said about us addressing the wrong issue within the car industry as I see it reflected in many of our lifestyle decisions. Instead of looking at the car itself, we have been focusing on emissions, when it is the car that is the true problem. We have come to rely on technology to solve our every need, but technology comes with a price, and oftentimes that price is taken out on the Earth.
<br><br>
“In the US, cars are cool.” 
<br><br>
I never understood this. I loved public transportation, especially after living in a city in France for a year in which I only used public transport to get around. Even traveling across the country, I used public transportation. In my own town, I preferred biking or walking around to cars. 
<br><br>
Even then, the “cool car culture” began to draw me in. I started to believe that I needed to get a car. My uncle was disappointed when I didn’t have my license by 16 because he thought that I already should’ve had a car of my own. My uncle is very liberal, but he was born and raised into a society that said that cars were not only necessary to life, they were cool. Public transportation should have been a project that we started long ago, but we have been lacking, blind, and simply under the control of big fossil fuel and car companies. Now, we are influencing other countries to do the same.
</p><hr>

<p>
For many people, it seems that electric cars will be a solution to solve the environemal problem, and an increasing amount of people tend to choose such new-style cars. However, the statistics tell a different story, which indicates that half of harmful gases are actually released by electric cars actually release every year, and the production process of electric cars will cause more damage to the environment. In the lecture, Ken also mentions the opinion that to foster public transportation will also contribute to this issue by attracting more people to give private cars and choose buses or undergrounds. And in such way, the fuels will be taken the best use and will also diminish such inevitable negative influences to the environment.

I do think we should change our way of life, especially when we are considering getting a new car. But we need to admit the convenience of cars. As a college student without a driver's license, I use the bus to go downtown everytime. First of all, it’s cheap-I don’t even need to pay for it. But there’s one problem with it, it’s time consuming, and I need to wait at the bus stop. Even though there’s a schedule for the buses, they are not always on time. I know it may sound picky, sometimes buses are not that clean and safe. I still use it to go somewhere near like the marketplace. But for long-distance travel like going to LA, I’ll still choose to sit in a car with my friends. It’s faster and more comfortable. I agree that it’s people’s minds that need to change. Like what you have mentioned in the video, people think it’s cool to get a car. I just think that before somebody even thinks about getting a car in the future, think more thoroughly about whether he or she really needs a car. Facing such a huge climate problem, each of us should indeed do something, but at the same time, economy is an important issue too. If a majority of people don’t buy cars, just imagine how many people will lose their job from the car industry. We can reduce our carbon footprint in other ways too, eating less beef for example. Food waste is a big problem causing the greenhouse gas and destroying the environment. So I think the culture needs to make some changes, “the classic American life” needs to change to a more environmental friendly way,like getting a smaller house. But for many of us, we still need a car, maybe later, after we have a family, and get only one car.

It’s relatively crazy to imagine the impact regular cars have on the environment. Being that I work Valet currently, when driving any type of electric car I always wonder to myself why isn’t everybody driving them? Even being that my car isn’t electric due to expenses, I realize in the future, it’s without a doubt that I’ll be driving an electric vehicle. The benefits of this alternative on prices, using just electricity, and on the environment are just monumental to reasons why everyone should hop on this wave. I do also agree bikes are a better alternative as places like New York City and Isla Vista are demonstrating this already. I do also agree that this problem is a cultural problem not only for America, but various other countries across the world. As Ken mentioned, the work of automobile industry, especially in North America is immense in the growth and development of it. The reality of this is that it’s very difficult at this point to change that idea of how people think about this still. The overall idea of fixing this problem as a culture is fascinating and in my interest 100%, but the steps needed to take this from our whole society will take a lot of work.
</p><hr>

<p>
Isla Vista is the perfect example of why having a car can be unnecessary. Everything a person could want, ranging from food to toiletries is within a 2 mile radius. Here, biking is easy and arguably the best way to get around. But I'm not of the mindset that Isla Vista is representative of most of America, much less the world. The fact remains that, despite Ken's loathing for the suburbs, that a large percent of Americans do not live in local havens like Isla Vista or large cities like New York. In this context, pointing out that eliminating cars would be beneficial to combating the climate crisis is a waste of breath, and can also be a detriment to the climate change cause. 
<br><Br>
Because of the widespread dispersion of homes and cities in America, combined with the reliance on cars and car-based infrastructure instilled in us post-WWII, stating that the elimination of cars is a great to solution to climate change is the equivalent to sending your thoughts and prayers to those affected by a natural disaster. The average commute for an American is 16.7 miles, twice as long as the average commute in the UK, who has the longest commute in Europe. Implementing mass transit in America is just whole other beast, and quite frankly, would take too long to plan and build (The 10 freeway by my house has been under construction since I was 8, and this for one of the largest highways in one of the most car-centric cities in the country). We simply don't have the time for this solution.
</p><hr>

<p>
Let me get this straight, I would love to see public mass transit, like busses, light rail, and trains become the norm in the United States, but frankly, I think it’s a lost cause… for most people anyway. I want to talk about this from my personal perspective… one from Seattle. The city of Seattle and its surrounding neighborhoods have prided themselves in being on the forefront of environmental activism and environmentalism and have increasingly pushed for ways to reduce the city’s carbon emissions. The city of Seattle’s public utility is almost entirely powered by hydroelectric power, making the electricity in the city relatively carbon neutral, for example. However, the issue of transportation in the city is always on everyone’s mind… as Seattle is considered by some to have the worst traffic in the country after Los Angeles. Seattle has been trying for decades to implement a light rail system and expand its bus services, which they are attempting to do with Sound Transit 3. This very slow, ongoing, and insufficient project is a small step being made toward increasing transportation capacity between some of the biggest technology companies in the Northwest, Amazon and Microsoft. Last year, I-976 was approved by Washington voters, capping car tabs at $30, drastically effecting public transportation funding, and putting the implementation of the much needed and already slow process, in jeopardy of more delay. The public system is awful, and very few people can use it effectively. For example, the house where I grew up, in one of the major close Seattle suburbs, was a 45-minute walk from the nearest bus stop. Everyone in Seattle, unless they live in downtown, on the one short light rail system, or right next to the few navigable bike paths, drives. And essentially everyone on the east side of Lake Washington drives. Part of the issue is care culture, and part of it is car necessity. I’m of the school of thought that those with outdated views will have to die in order for more progressive and communal views to be in decision making spaces. The large issue in Seattle is that there exists a car culture and need, that has not been supplemented or discouraged by the older generations in power in order to do effective city planning for the future. This culture, I think is lost on Americans, who have never known efficient, effective public transit, and frankly wont any time soon. I think that electric cars in the USA are partly part of the solution in this country in particular. The only way for my mother to get to work in Seattle is to drive. She drives an electric vehicle, however charges it at home, where electricity is produced by the private electric monopoly Puget Sound Energy (PSE), which gains large amounts of its electricity from coal in Montana and natural gas. I would like to see change on this issue, but I think that for many places, particularly in the United States, and not necessarily the world, it will be very difficult and not something that will be achievable or occur on any short desirable timescale.

Before watching Ken's video, I didn't even think to ask what the carbon footprint of producing an electric car was and how that contributes to our own impact. The idea that even if we bought a car, and left it to sit in the driveway, we would still be exceeding the safe amount of carbon emissions per year, once we allot for food, clothing, etc was insane. This really put into perspective the idea of a future without cars, as one of our single biggest sources of emissions and the hazards that come with them, it's understandable why we should do away with cars. But is this doable?
<br><br>
I completely agree that if given the option, it is possible for people to give up cars completely, in an ideal world, but change does have to start socially, culturally and structurally. Many cities don't have a public transportation system that could effectively transport thousands of people to where they need to be, largely due to company lobbying and lack of federal funding, but to make such a drastic change in American lives we must first be able to support a hell of an increase in mass transit. Not to mention the way cities and suburbs are structured, it's nearly impossible to be able to reach every area in a time and resource-effective way. City structure change along with increased funding for mass transit would be the start to being able to switch from a car-based society to one that popularizes the eco-friendly transportation system.

I love driving. I look forward to the 4-hour drive from UCSB to my parents’ home every few weeks, and the thought of giving up long drives through the mountains breaks my heart. I’ve always felt safe in the fact that, although my gas-guzzling Volkswagen isn’t sustainable in the slightest, someday I could switch to an electric vehicle and continue my road trips guilt-free. This lecture changed my entire perspective on electric cars and cars in general, however. When Ken broke down that owning an electric vehicle for the average car lifespan of eleven years would be equivalent to emitting 2 metric tons of CO2 each of those years, my heart sank. It seems that owning a Tesla isn’t such a guilt-free choice after all. But as I was feeling disappointed by these facts, Ken changed my perspective even further by explaining that instead of owning a car for a sense of “freedom,” the money spent each year to own a vehicle can instead be used for necessities, allowing one to work one less day a week, or retire much earlier. I agree with Ken that this seems like a much greater freedom than the car industry advertises so heavily. So, although I might be losing one of my favorite past times by giving up my beloved Beetle, I’ll gain the time to find a new favorite activity, and I’ll be doing what’s needed to start fixing our planet.

</p><hr>

<p>
This lecture did a great job of dispelling many misconceptions I had about the efficiency, costs, and environmental costs of owning a car in today's world. 
<br><br>

One major misconception I had was that electric cars was the one-for-all solution for the transportation industry. I praised leaders such as Elon Musk who have promoted electric cars as the environmentally and cost efficient future of transportation. However, the professor provided statistics that tell us otherwise. Each person on the planet can emit no more than 2  metric tons of CO2 per year. Although the average electric car releases about half of the amount of harmful gases per year as compared to gas based cars, the production of electric cars is actually more. In fact, assuming that you own each car for approximately 11 years,  by just leaving the car off in your driveway, you have already met your yearly 2 metric tons limit. 
<br><br>


The professor introduces an idea of fostering public transportation to make it more appealing for people to want to use instead of cars. This means making buses, trains, and other forms of transport easier to access, more comfortable, and more reliable. By doing this,  we can tap into the reasons why people use cars in the first place. By providing these benefits in public transportation, along with providing a more fuel efficient way of travelling, people will be more inclined to move towards alternatives. 

<br><br>

The concept of cities being more efficient than suburban areas is also interesting to me. People in cities depend less on individual transport and more on public transportation like subways. From experiences from visiting major cities such as New York and Boston, I clearly saw that this was the case. People did not want the hassle of having to trying to drive everywhere and find parking and so they depended on easy to use and efficient alternatives. However, I believe that his phenomena of using public transport over individual transport only really makes sense if the public transportation provided is actually satisfactory. For example, compared to the subways in Chicago or New York, the BART system in San Francisco is very unappealing. As a result, even though it does seem more convenient to use BART, I have noticed that a lot of people are more inclined to avoid this form of transport.
</p><hr>

<p>
As the example Professor Ken mentioned, the electrical car did not help with reducing global footprint due to the significant carbon emission in production progress. So, from what I know, I personally do not believe that technology can solve the global warming and other environmental problems. Cultural lifestyle would be effective way to approach the solution I sure. At the same time, I am thinking about the question in the video, why people rather driving relatively costly car than taking cheaper bus and subway? In the other way, why bus taking is not cooler than in the car? Imagine someone in the movie, if you are watching a movie about successful life or beautiful life, well, mostly the movie will show the main character happily driving on the car instead of sitting in the bus or subway. I think that someone will feel the same with me. For my point of view, I like taking bus and subway, the lifestyle I am enjoy in will not be the best lifestyle others will love, but I believe that as long as I keep the lifestyle, more and more people will possibly change their lifestyle.
</p><hr>

<p>
From this lecture video I find it very interesting that even though being looked at as a cleaner alternative to gas-burning cars, electric cars emit 48-65%. This is insane to me, everyone and their mom is convinced that electric cars are so much better for the planet. Do Americans really think that electric cars are that much better for the environment or are electric cars the cool new thing in the eyes of tech-savvy Americans? Americans as a whole are amazingly materialistic. 
<br><br>
Fast fashion is one of the most materialistic aspects of our economy. people are paid boatloads of money to come up with new styles daily and to promote those new styles. People are extremely gullible are want to do anything they can to fit in, like sheep. These companies know how the average American mind works and they cater to that need to fit in. Americans are the top for CO2 emissions besides China because America is such a materialistic country.
</p><hr>

<p>
After watching this video, I felt shocked that vehicles have huge negative influence than positive effect. First of all, cars would produce many carbon dioxide that cause global warming and pollute the air. Secondly, there are many traffic accidents in a year that many young people lose their life. What’s more, it costs a lot of money to have a car which is not necessary. Many people think that having a car means cool and successful; however, having a car also means else: it is convenient to have a car if you live in suburban, maybe two car. But taking public transportation is also convenient that you could save more money and should not have to worry about the climate problem. Technology nowadays should come up more ideas and solution to solve the gasoline problem that could use less gasoline to produce more energy and reach the productivity.
</p><hr>

<p>
This video was all too perfect for me. Ever since sophomore year of high school when everyone got their first cars, I have been looking for as many excuses as possible not to go through with taking the time to do my permit test and do driver ed, etc. Basically out of pure laziness I never learned to drive. I am now realizing that I was unintentionally doing the earth a great service, so… you’re welcome. Jokes aside, I was especially intrigued by the concept behind this video. However, growing up in a suburb in the bay area, I am a bit skeptical about the idea of not having cars. In the Bay, we have one of the best public transits in the country, BART. And I used Bart to get all around the region and for a reasonable price as well. The issue I would be concerned about is how I would get around within my town. For example, if my hypothetical future son needs to get to a baseball game and its a few miles away. The suburb I lived in was incredibly hilly and without a solid bus system. Meaning I would likely have to walk around a mile up and down hills to the closest bus stop just to get to a little league baseball game? Biking is technically possible but due to the hills, it is pretty difficult to get around quickly and efficiently. I guess that is the price you pay for helping out the environment, and by no means am I saying the price is not worth paying, but I cannot imagine many people in my town making this massive lifestyle adjustment. This also could simply be an issue that is unique to my geographical area, but I would be willing to bet it is an issue elsewhere as well. It appears the only definitive way to make this “no car” system work is to live in a city, but San Francisco and many cities in America are already reaching max capacity. Overcrowding and increasing house prices are becoming a massive issue across the United States and having affluent, suburban families migrate into the cities will likely just gentrify the city and displace thousands of poorer Americans. I would love to hear some solutions to this issue because this video made it abundantly clear that something needs to be done to address this.

It is so striking to realize that just purchasing a car creates such a large carbon footprint. Personally, the allure for owning a car comes from the autonomy that you get with one. Being in college has definitely changed my perception on the necessity of a car. I am able to go shopping downtown if I want by bus and I can get to places like Costco and Target for food very easily. I can also get around very easily by bike, which has the added benefit of exercise. I do think there are still challenges without a car, especially for people in rural areas. It think one solution would be to have people in suburbs "car-share." 3 to 5 families would pool together their money and buy a car. That car would then be able to be used for things like buying groceries and would be used by each family on certain days/times. This would allow a great amount of autonomy for people in the suburbs while greatly reducing their carbon footprint in transportation. I believe a carbon tax would also greatly help families move toward such a solution.

<p>
It is interesting that I can often rebuild some of my environmental perceptions after learning Ken’s class materials. After watching the lecture video “Why the climate crisis is a cultural problem (and why electric cars are more trouble than good”, I felt kind of shocked that electric cars are not that environmentally friendly. If people want to approach the goal Paris made on cop21 which limits the carbon emission from 1.5-2 Celsius degrees, each person can only emit no more than 2 metric tons of CO2 or equivalent gases per year. Surprisingly, the gas production of manufacturing a new car is equivalent to an individual person’s whole year carbon footprints. So, if you just purchase a car, you already exceed the average carbon emission. As a result, it is ineffective to focus on the car production or car use in a technology aspect. Instead, we need to reengineer the cultural practice of car use. Indeed, we have really good transportation to carry people go the farthest way by using oil as less as possible. The fact is that people have the wants to pursue a car. What the environmentalists hope are to make people change this idea and stop the car fashion. I agree to the idea in the lecture that no matter how hard we try making a 5,000 pound vehicle to carry one person cannot be environmentally friendly tot the planet. However, sometimes it is really hard to go out without a car. The lecture mentioned that people can go from LA to NY by only 4 gallons. It is an astonishing piece of data, but weak persuasion. Because the less oil consumption means more time consumption. It is important for modern people to give up their time to keep green. From my perspective, another problem is that public transportation is not that complete. For example, the bus stop is 1.6 miles away from the big market Trader Joe’s and Albertson in SB. If you want to take bus to buy stuff, you need walk 1.6 miles with all your heavy stuff. Besides, the Amtrak is always delayed which is also a big problem. All of these made me think that owning a car is a more convenient way to go out.

I strongly agree with you. Sometimes cars can really make our life more convenient. As a college student who does not have a car, I always complain to my friends about trouble without cars. It is really chilling on the morning here, I think it is better for us to drive to school in this case. Also biking is limited, if we want to go to Santa Barbara downtown by biking, then it might take an hour. It is also not convenient to take bus. If you take bus at late night, you need to wait for a long time. Ken mentioned that it has become a cultural thing. People love cars. It starts from Europe and America, then it spreads to many places in the world. It is true that driving too much will cause a big burden for our environment, but I do believe we can finally make driving less polluting. I am also shocked by the fact that electric cars are not so environmentally friendly. As time goes, cars will become less polluting and more people can benefit from its convenience.

As an electric car owner, I definitely felt like I was benefiting the climate by owning it. Because of the smaller carbon footprint, I felt like I was doing our climate a service because, I mean, hey, it’s better than most cars. But as you explain in the lecture, all of the unknown factors I never accounted for in the production of cars showed me how, in general, driving a car is a crime to our climate. The fact that owning a car in America is seen as such a necessity, even after all of the costs, dangers, and impacts it has, proves change lies within culture change. We can’t rely on new developments, like electric cars to ‘save’ us. What will really save us, is our ability to act and change the way we consume as a society. The fact that just buying a car is equivalent to two metric tons of CO2, (the maximum amount of carbon emissions we should use on a yearly basis) is astonishing. We need to realize that technological developments require mass carbon footprints to produce, so it can't feasibly be the solution to our climate crisis problems. We need to enact REAL change in order to curb the current situation of our climate. It all starts with change in our everyday life, but for many that’s a hard pill to swallow. Everyday inconveniences, however, will be the cure for our climate.

<p>
What's ironic to me is that the fact my recommended videos tagged with this one are a bunch of cars commercials. I just finished watching the film talking about how our culture is filled with advertisements that convinces us to buys things we don't need. And it shocked me how fast I already have found some examples in modern companies just straight up targeting users with ads, such as in this case how Youtube target viewers based on keywords like "car" from a video, even though this video is actually suggesting a "carless" life-style. 
<br><br>
Now you may argue just how stupid youtube's algorithm is, which I personally agree. But that's just an example of how ruthlessly these companies are in terms of encouraging a more consuming culture so they can earn more money, which ultimately leads to resources shortage(let's say, a stable amount for sustaining human society on Earth) and environmental problems such as climate changes. These companies again show no responsibilities or whatsoever in front of money, but it's only us and our culture to blame since everything links together so closely: they are advertising and offering what we have been demanding for decades!
<br><br>


Thus I agree on Ken's opinion about how the climate crisis is essentially a climate problem, it is consistent and similar to the conclusions I had from readings earlier this quarter, and very closely connected to the film "Minimalism". And furthermore what Ken mentioned in the video such as in China reminded me of something I always have in mind. In China, the car owning rates increased as a economical growth over years has only contributes more to the climate crisis, but there are developing countries other than China that are adapting a similar consuming culture as U.S.' as they grow their economics. 
<br><br>



It's kind of depressing to think that even developed counties like United States which has already past through the "growing phase" can't seem to have "protect the environment first" as a mainstream mindset for everybody(part of role of this course is to bring conscious to people's mind), what kind of nightmare awaits us in the future? since high populations countries such as China and India obviously don't have as much of a focus on protecting environment as growing our economy.
<br><br>


The one thing I want to say is that a miraclely change in culture in Unite States can be very important as an example showing the world what kind of worldview and value will lead to a greener Earth we all lived upon, and second: we shouldn't just be limiting our views and concerns on US, even though it is definitely a great step and something more relevant to most people here.
</p><hr>

<p>
The way that things are advertised to the public are the ways that people process the information. We are not taught to question the importance or the impacts of things that we consume. Cars for example are sold under the pretense that they give people freedom. Cars were seen as a symbol of freedom, because it gives us a way of getting around without relying on someone else. However, like Ken mentioned it is another way to trap people with debt. It is also a cause of death and yet these are not things that come to mind when purchasing a vehicle. There are many different ways that we could get around more sufficiently, but I think that major changes in public transportation need to be made. We need to change our views on public transportation, because it is seen as something that people do only out of necessity. It needs to be seen as the norm because it is better for the planet and we have the ability to make it efficient and make traveling easier. Public transportation does not get enough hype, it allows people to continue working (because they do not have to drive), allows for more sleep, better for the planet, cheaper and it allows for more human interaction.
</p><hr>

<p>
I think both will happen. Americans will soon realize the importance of making lifestyle changes and these will encourage people to develop new technologies that further the trend. I am not sure if riding the bus will suddenly become trendy, but in the past five years, I have noticed more people carpooling and a greater interest in trains. I know that in San Francisco on one of the busiest streets they have just banned all cars and the only vehicles allowed are busses and bikes. I can see a lot more metropolitan areas adopting ideas like this to the point where hopefully it limits the use of cars, especially the cars that only transport one person. I know there are some smaller American cities that offer free public transportation as a way to be more environmentally conscious and if large cities budget themselves to do the same we will start to see actual change.

I agree with your point, such changes in transportation won’t be able to happen overnight. As a matter of fact, it will most likely take a while to get a majority of the general public on board with public transportation. But with government procedure and help, I think that public transportation can definitely be stressed and integrated more into everyday life. 
<br><br>
For example, public transportation in a city like Los Angeles seems to be a terrible idea at first (confusing, messy, for a lack of a better term: not user friendly), but in reality it just takes a little bit of patience and learning. There’s many upsides to public transportation such as less traffic—however people aren’t very willing to put forward the patience and time into learning. Perhaps with sufficient budgeting, public transportation can be way more integrated into the lives of many and not just a few.

I don't think that it is going to be possible to get people to stop wanting cars right now. They are simply too convenient and too necessary. We have built massive infrastructure around them: highways, roads, entire cities. There is a very high sunk cost, and they too ingrained in our culture for people to stop using them (voluntarily) in the US. 
<br><br>

 In comparison to traditional cars, electric cars are still better environmentally. Sure, it would be nice to live in a world without them, but I don't think that is realistic right now without sweeping changes to public transportation infrastructure. 
<br><br>


In New York, no one drives because public transportation is generally faster and more convenient. If it was faster and more convenient to go anywhere in the US by public transportation, then most people would use public transportation. Public transportation being "cool" isn't enough for everyone to use it, it has to actually be better.
 
<br><br>


In the future, not everyone would need to own a car to drive one. Autonomous cars are here today. Soon, many people could share the same car through some kind of autonomous ride-sharing which is something many companies are working on. This would significantly cut down on the carbon footprint, as well as reduce the number of cars on the road while maintaining the convenience.
</p><hr>

<p>
I think one of the reasons why cars have become a goal and something deeply desired by people is the idea that once you've bought a car, you've taken a step to becoming independent and responsible, there are many other reasons such as the privacy of your own car and the freedom to do whatever you want with it. Since advertisements only show a car's good qualities, we're inevitably going to grow up thinking that they have more pros than cons. But when you really sit down to think about it, cars a hassle too; you have to pay your car off, pay for insurance, do regular check ups, drive through traffic, find parking spots, pay for parking spots, and on top of that, they hurt the environment tremendously. People from urban cities are always complaining about the traffic but WE ARE the traffic. When I'm on the freeway I check to see how many drivers are alone and most of them are! People think public transport is gross and embarrassing when 1) you don't have to drive 2) you don't have to worry about gasoline 3) you save money for your future. Being able to retire in our late 40s in exchange for not buying a car sounds pretty good to me. People also want to own cars because they want to go places, on their own. I can understand this because I use public transportation for everything and it does suck sometimes to get out of work, have to wait 20 minutes for the bus to come and then have to walk some more. I think one of the best things about cars are that they save time and a lot of people believe that time is money, and it is in various occasions. We've also developed a culture in which people want things instantly and cars provide that instant availability and mobility. 
<br><br>
I used to think that cars were a necessity, and maybe sometimes they are when you have a family but even then we need to make smarter use of our cars. For example, only use the car when going to far locations or when you need to be somewhere urgently because honestly, there are buses and other means of public transportation that can take you anywhere in a reasonable amount of time but we have to learn to be patient and be more humble. It's definitely something that should be promoted as much as an upcoming movie or the next iPhone, this stuff is important and people need to know the harms of their daily-life practices and be educated on what they can do to live a more sustainable life.

I thought this lecture was quite interesting. Before watching this lecture, I did know that electric cars did not make much of a positive difference, but that's about all I knew. Everything else in this lecture was brand new information for me. Ken is right-- we cannot wait for someone like Elon Musk to solve our climate crisis, we must do it ourselves. I used to drive a hybrid Prius before I moved to college, but now I walk and ride my bike everywhere. This is a privilege for me, because of my physical abilities and because of the layout of Isla Vista. It feels good to have that privilege and it sure does save me money too. But will I be able to continue riding my bike everywhere after I graduate? I am not sure, especially with population increasing, the number of educated people increasing, and jobs becoming more impacted. I might have to drive to work. I am also a musician and I need a way to transport my gear-- I guess that's what band vans are for. I think sharing vehicles within a household is a great idea until we have the ability to eliminate them more.

It is becoming increasingly clear that the American lifestyle must be changed if we are to combat the climate crisis. The changes do not need to be drastic, but they do need to happen. If every American reduced the amount of meat they eat, the number of material objects they consume, and the amount they used their car, even by a small amount, then carbon emissions would be significantly reduced. It is sad to see so many companies trying to convince the public that simply buying their product instead of another company's will fix the problem rather than never buying the product at all. In this case, this applies to the difference between buying an electric car, buying a gas-powered car, or not buying a car at all and instead relying on public transportation. I had always thought that buying an electric car would be a great way to fight the climate crisis, and it was disturbing to see how even electric cars contribute so much to the climate crisis. 
<br><br>

It makes me incredibly sad to just keep learning different ways in which large companies are manipulating the public in ways that exacerbate the climate crisis. The advertising surrounding electric cars, and cars in general, and the power that the automobile industry has is just one example. I wish there was a way to educate people about the costs of their actions and encourage them to make slight adjustments to their lifestyles that would help improve the condition of the planet, rather than large companies and groups of people spending a lot of money to convince people not to change anything and keep buying their products.

Car culture is very popular in the United States. The average family has two to three cars. In contrast, many Chinese families don't even have a car. In 1985 China had only 1.72 million cars, and an average of 780 people had one car. Even if it has increased a hundredfold now, it is still a car for seven people. A married man would easily forget the sadness of his bachelor years. We should also respect the right of others to pursue convenience. I never knew that electric cars would be even more unfriendly to the environment. But the cost of car transportation cannot be measured by price alone compared to buses. Cars also bring time savings and improved comfort. The time and energy saved may create greater value.  Before the use of cars, people used horse-drawn carriages. At that time, the environmental pollution of horse-drawn carriages did not require less cars. Horse dung will permeate the air.

I was surprised by Ken mentioning that cars do not emit that much CO2 while operating, which indicates even though you buy a car and put it in your garage and never use it, the manufactured car has already emitted amounts of CO2. Besides, Ken also mentioned that each personal planet cannot reach two metric tons of CO2 or equivalent gases. However, manufacturing a car without operating it has already reached the limit. Then, Ken talked about today's electric cars. Before watching the video, I thought electric cars like Tesla are today's most meaningful invention for saving our planet with adopting new technology. I was quite surprised and sad when knowing that electric don't really help to solve the real problems behind. That is cultural recognization. Honestly, when i saw the name of this video, i don't really understand why Ken combines climate crisis with the impacts from cultural problems. I previously thought cars are called necessities. Indeed, people do need cars to move and connect within long distances. Cars are obviously making our lives more easier and more convenient, but also more dangerous to destroy our planet. After watching the video, i sort cars into the goods of desire. Take my parents for instance, i witnessed they bought a new car even if their first car hasn't been used for 3 years. I thought they were just pursuing to have an upper version of that car. But indeed, that's called desire. I am not saying my parents want to show off but it's just the psychological need for every person in the society. People work hard and save money in order to get their dream cars one day. Even though we know that public transportation is cheaper, but we just desire the privacy, the superiority a car could bring to us. So before asking people or telling my parents not to buy cars, the first thing we need to do is to use the knowledge we learned today to change the way people believe. This will be a long-run cultural change.

<p>
The main idea brought up by Ken in this video is very important. Cars are terrible for the environment, for they rely on fossil fuels. They roughly take one work day’s salary a week in order to maintain, and they are incredibly dangerous to drive. Why is this our main source of transportation here in the United States? With public transportation being a proven safer, cheaper, more eco-friendly option, why is it that we still prefer driving cars? Just as Ken brought up, it is ingrained in our culture that cars are “cool” and public transportation is not. This is an example of a huge issue we are dealing with during this climate crisis.
<br><Br>
 I recently went to a faculty panel which addressed fracking in relation to the climate crisis and a very enlightening idea was brought to my attention by a professor. When it comes to being more efficient and environmentally friendly, the question isn’t how do we come up with the options; the question is how do we make these options attractive to the public. How do you make people want to switch to these new, more environmentally sound ideas? This directly relates to Ken’s video where he states that we need to make public transportation look more appealing in our society, that way others will follow.
</p><hr>


<p>
I was surprised that manufacturing an electric car emits more greenhouse gases than a regular counterpart. In all, I agree with Ken's suggestion to change our mind to think that going with mass transportation is good. Back in my hometown, I travel with mass transportation like buses and subways all the time, even though my parents constantly putting effort to persuade my buying a car. However, this can only be realized with good coverage of public transport network. My hometown is a major city in our country thus has the privilege to have a system of mass transportation that could reach every corner in our city. In contrast, here in Santa Barbara, only one bus from IV to downtown every 20-30 minutes. It is just not time efficient. Major cities like Boston, has only a 2 compartment train every 8-20 minutes. What I am saying is that some massive transportation are just not efficient so that people would rather travel by car, not to even think about whether it is cool or not. Thus, I think it is necessary to have a great coverage of transportation and it is better operated by government because they are obligated to provide the service and only they are possible to afford the deficit caused by massive transportation with low ticket price.

In this lecture, Ken chose to speak out about cars. Cars are something that has almost become synonymous with American culture. The US alone is responsible for such a high percentage of emissions through cars and it has begun to spread. Starting at the beginning, however, America’s dependence on cars began when they were first introduced and the big companies as well as politicians pushed to make cars popular. They marketed the vehicle as a means of freedom, to go where you want, when you want on your own terms. While this entire concept is extremely appealing statistics don’t side with feelings on this one. As mentioned throughout lecture cars are a huge primary emitter for greenhouse gasses and fossil fuel emissions. They spit out waste and are realistically not safe. However, since these car companies have gotten America hooked on cars, it had begun to spread. Places like India and China are seeing America’s greedy and materialistic lifestyle and are choosing to mimic this behavior through the purchases of cars. As someone who is 20 and still doesn’t even have their permit (yikes I know), I have had no issues getting around on public transport my whole life. I have worked multiple jobs and have still made it to all my shifts through the uses of busses. So I am 100% on board on the notion that cars aren't necessarily a necessity. What I was surprised about was how much, long term, a car will end up costing the average US consumer. THe fact that eliminating a car from your life could theoretically lead to an early retirement is a happy thought.

I love how you mentioned that "the fact that eliminating a car from your life could theoretically lead to an early retirement is a happy thought"! I did not know this actually, but that is for sure very intriguing. Makes me feel better about not owning a vehicle myself nor see myself owning one anytime soon. I do find it disappointing though that other countries feel as though it would do them right to mimic our poor choices as a country of encouraging the use of personal vehicles as opposed to public transformation. So not only are we slowly diminishing our planet, but we are watching other countries do the same thing after being influenced by us. We REALLY owe one to our poor planet... I agree with your stance on cars not being a necessity. A bus can get me to the same place that a car can get me, so why not do the planet a favor and help prevent more carbon dioxide from transmitting into the air. The "cool" thing should be to help save the planet rather than owning and driving a car. Why is it cool to contribute to climate crisis? We are only going to suffer major consequences from it all later on.

What really intrigued me in this video was the talk about cities. Cities are proving to be so much better for the environment per person due to the use of public transport and the smaller, more communal living spaces that you would think everyone would support them. Instead, I feel as though usually people blame cities. They say that obviously since there’s more people and you can see the smog in the air that cities are the things ruining the planet. It’s insane to me that people can believe this so whole heartedly and then return to their suburban mcmansion in their large SUV and believe that somehow they are doing better. 
<br><br>
To me, this all looks like a side affect of the skewed American Dream, just as Ken touched on in this video. The idea of suburbia and a white picket fence life has contributed so much to the climate crisis, and honestly the suffering of the average American as a whole. The idealistic fantasies we’ve created around such an average life centered around materialism is making us crave something we can never have and look outwards instead of inwards for happiness. It doesn’t work, but because of it we have become worse people to ourselves, to each other, and to the world we live in.

I feel that a good way to approach this problem would literally be to pimp out mass transit vehicles. I would definitely want to ride in a bus or train if there are cool things to do in there such as having more comfortable seats, a TV playing a movie in there, refreshments for people and if the vehicle looks cool as hell like a party bus or the physical features of a nice car without ads or homeless people. These forms of transportation seem to have been left behind in the past and they don't appeal to society like how cars do. If there were more advertisements about taking these forms of transportation on TV, then more people would want to ride in them. People don't care about convenience, they care about clout so they would gladly wait hours in traffic if it means that they get to drive their dream car. One way to make more people take these forms of transportation would be to add a sin tax when purchasing a car so that the prices go up. If there is a sin tax on things that could kill you such as cigarettes and alcohol then there should especially be one for cars since many fatal accidents occur. I found it intriguing when Ken detailed that we could retire earlier if we saved the money spent on cars, because I want to live my life and maybe become famous and travel without worrying about work the next day. All we need is for Kylie Jenner to pose in a bus and say something in the lines of "I love riding the bus" and that would attract millions of people to do the same. We all know that would never happen though. I feel that we should also transition away from living in the suburbs and focus more on providing housing in cities because it's more efficient to go to work when you're already close to your work so you won't need to take a car thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions and it'll be your exercise for the day.

<p>
Okay, I completely agree with Ken and hear his point. What he is saying is valid, the statistics add up and ultimately cars are not the answer. Cars and driving are a developmental milestone in America and are a huge part of our culture, there is no denying this and yes maybe this isn't a good thing… I have a couple of issues though. 
<br><br>
It just is much harder said than done. I do not use a car often, infact i dont even have a license- but simply not using cars is kinda a cop out to me because they are already so pervasive. Also, let's consider the reality of public transit for a minute. Public transit in california is simple not well funded and is often ineffective in my experience, and I feel as though my opinion is valid because I have used it a lot. Idealistically yes, if public transit was a more safe option then yes i would opt to use it 100 percent of the time, but in reality it is not. I am a small nineteen year old girl, i can hardly walk around off campus in public without getting harassed, and i will say one of the most threatening and vulnerable places for me would be public transit. The amount of times I have been bothered while using the metro back home or even the bus here is enough to have made me never want to use it at all- and I do not mean a small cat call, i mean serious harassment. It is easy for Ken to suggest this, in an ideal world where there aren't creeps out there and women are guaranteed safety in public spheres… this just is not our reality. I could never take the bus after 7pm, and honestly taking it alone regardless the time of day is scary especially back in LA. So where does that leave me? This is something i find myself questioning week after week, all these things just feel like bandaids to cover the only real solution and that's policy change.
<br><br>
Policy change is the only viable solution in the case of cars too. Maybe if the government cared more about enforcing safe public transit, more people would opt to use it. Its all about policy, everything else just doesn't seem valid to me.

Why are cars so cool. Cars offer a place a solitude, an immediate separation from the outside world. Buses/trains, though environmentally friendly do not offer this kind of privacy one gets in a car.  I for one, look forward to time spent in my car as it allows me to decompress and get away from the outside world, it is my haven on a rough concrete road in unfamiliar places. I drive a used 1999 Toyota 4runner. I have had it for five years and it is in excellent condition. It is also paid off and I only pay insurance. Why would someone like me give up their car in favor of public transportation. Sadly I am not the only one with this mindset and frankly, it is hard for me to shake. I have connection with my car, Ive taken it to other states, Ive slept in it. 
<br><br>
It is surprising that electric cars have just as significant of an environmental impact as their gas fueled competitors, however public transportation, especially in urban areas do not offer people the "friend" on the road the car does. In a car, you feel safe from the outside world. On a bus, train, or any type of public transit you are exposed to aspects/walks of life you do not necessarily want to be exposed to. I apologize if this comes off as non-progressive or unfriendly to our climate crisis but the human need for privacy outweighs the interest of commuting with other people if you have the choice.

It is true that the number of cars people possess in China is large. However, comparing to the United States, Chinese public transportation is much more convenient. There are many cars in China is because the population is huge. There are also many people using public transportation to commute. Take Beijing subway system as an example. There are almost twenty subway lines. However, subway stations are still filled with people during morning and evening peak. Also, traffic jams happen on the streets. Besides, in Beijing, you can not buy a car whenever you want. Every citizen in Beijing has to participate in a lottery for license plates if you want a license plate. What’s more, limitation of license plate number is operating. This means, if your last number of license plate is 0 or 5, you can not drive on Mondays; if your last number of license plate is 1 or 6, you can not drive on Tuesdays; the rest can be done in the same manner. Government in China has already implemented some policies to reduce to use of cars, and the majority of citizens obey the rules, or otherwise they must pay for the fine. But what happened in the United States is that almost each family has more than one vehicles, even high school student gets one. American cars are so cheap that they are affordable to almost every American family. Also, American public transportation is slow and not widespread, and people seldom use buses or subways. Thus, American citizens can only purchase a car and drive to hang out. Having a car also represents the status of a person. The richer a car the person get, the more successful the person is. But actually, expensive cars exhaust more gas emissions. As a result, climate crisis is always a cultural problem.

I think that technological advancement is simply one mechanism in a larger equation that will be necessary to combat the impacts of climate change that have brought about by our excessive emissions of fossil fuels, due in large part to the emissions resulting from the cars we drive every day. As Ken stated, buying a new car every 11 years, even without driving it even once, makes fossil fuel consumption for a human exceed the total that should ever be emitted by that one individual over their entire life. Clearly, we have the data at hand to prove that automobiles comparatively extremely inefficient to other modes of transportation such as buses or trains. So why is it that we as consumers insist on having a car? We know its bad for the environment to drive, costly in terms of production, and it places a huge financial burden on many, particularly those who must drive to work due to a lack of other reasonable options. What it comes down to is this: We buy cars because the federal government and the system of capitalism that they support depend on the continued existence and success of the automobile industry. To that end, they are willing to invest mass amounts of resources in the automobile industry and the vast and complex system of roads and infrastructure that they require. 
<br><br>
Make no mistake, the lack of affordable and sustainable public transportation outside of any major city is no accident or oversight that we are just now informed enough to fix, but a long term, high reward, calculated move made by our government and the CEOs of the automobile and fossil fuel industries to line their own pockets for years to come. Point being, a switch to mass production and advancement of electric cars may seem promising, but in reality, their production still results in large scale emissions, and also maintain the current social culture that requires cars as a sort of status symbol to prove our worth to others in the world around us. If high speed rail was developed to the same extent that our system of roads had been, traffic and gridlock would be a thing of the past, travel times would be cut dramatically, and commerce resulting from tourism would increase significantly, among other countless benefits. In reality, none of this will change until we as consumers stop allowing politicians and big automobile companies dictate almost the entire transportation sector/market in the U.S. So, like Ken has been saying, there is nothing more important that we can do for our planet’s future is to vote.

Don’t like electrical cars, honestly. It does surprise me that the process of making electrical cars produce “68% more CO2” than gasoline cars in factories. The makers like Tesla target their market by saying it saves the planet, but it seems like that’s not true. Never gonna buy one. And I do want to point out something here: about the electrical bus in China. I was born in Beijing and have lived there for almost 15 years. The only time I have seen electrical bus presented in Beijing is period between 2003 and 2008. After 2008, electrical bus is totally disappeared in the city. I have to say that the reason Beijing’s gov employs such bus at that time was not because they wanted to save the environment or they wanted to show their high technology but because the gov is too poor to support gasoline cars running in the city. Thus, to me, electrical cars are never the future of cars or technology; it's just a lie which seems so attractive. 
<br><br>
I have read some article about the future power source. one of them mentions "water power" and "Fusion," and I personally do believe it summarize the future of cars too. In my idea understanding, the future cars
<br><br>
should contain an engine that connect electricity at one side and water at the other side. Based upon H20+electricity=2H2+O2, this engine produces hydrogen and Oxygen. The Oxygen will be the gas emitting out; this solves the green house problem. And the hydrogen will go through to the center part of the engine where is a fusion with super high temperature. The hydrogen can go through the process 4H+Heat=He to release energy. The energy produced will separate to two part: one to generate more electricity, the other one goes to power the car. The only thing the people car need will be “distilled water.” The only process of getting this type of water will boost many many other fields as well.

When discussing issues with our modern society, one of the most prominent topics revolves around automobiles, especially its emission rate. You point out that our cars have damaged the environment more than it has benefited us. The carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere has greatly pushed us away from the Paris Agreement. Moreover, the point about electric cars are more damaging than gasoline cars because of the coal to produce electricity and manufacturing the parts. Through your tone, it seemed like that we have no solutions to revert the change that we caused, and technologies cannot resolve such issues. There are two things I disagree with such statements. Firstly, although automobiles, such as cars, trucks, ships, planes, and trains, do produce a significant amount of pollutant to the atmosphere, and it is one of the primary contributors to global warming, it has outdone its negative aspects through creating a world that is much more efficient and convenient to the majority. The ease of traveling, the efficiency of transporting goods and products; we now live in a world defined by automobiles.
<br><br>
Moreover, I believe that technology and technological advancements can most definitely work to fix the issue of our damaged atmosphere, and Elon Musk is not just giving fake promises to the world that he is trying to solve the problem of global warming. He is only one man, but if his suggestions are being listened to by the people of power, I believe that we can then finally stop relying on coal and gasoline. An optimistic mindset, proper education, and the right motivations, this can all indeed bring about positive changes as more of us are taking action!

As I was watching this video, first of all I was astonished that right after the "no technology will be good enough" talk came the "there is a solution: busses, trains, and subways" talk. We literally have technology that transports people QUICKLY and with small emissions! This made me think of a twitter post I was a couple of weeks ago that had a map of the US if we put into place the high speed electric trains that are commonly used in Europe. FIRST you could literally take an overnight train from New York to Los Angeles, SECOND it would be much cheaper than a plane ticket, AND NOW THIRD it makes the earth happy! Wow I never thought about how cars really aren't a good thing to invest yourself in. I have always known that they are not good for the environment, but I had kind of just accepted this as an unavoidable way of life. Now thinking about, the dangers, the cost, and the time and energy of maintenance in addition to the huge environmental burden they cause, cars seem very unattractive. I am so angry, this video almost got to the end without discussion corruption in politics BUT NO. Of course automobile industries are being selfish and the politicians play along! LAME
</p><hr>



<p>
I agree with Kenneth Hiltner about the issues on carbon emissions, however, this also poses another question. I believe that the convenience and usage of the car cannot be replaced within a couple of years; what happened to us previously already has done irreversible damage. But the question is, how will we make everything convenient and accessible to everyone? Imagine people living in rural cities, I don’t think it will be easy to make light rail trains accessible to everybody who lives between major cities. What about the people  living in the countryside? How are they expected to travel easily? I think it’s impossible to have train stations in every city. It’s stupid to expect people to ditch their vehicles. These solutions aren’t very realistic. 
<br><br>
Sure, electric cars are more trouble than good, but it’s a step in the right direction. You’re talking  about deciding against buying a car but what about the people who can’t even afford an electric  vehicle. It’s kind of ironic that making an electric car uses more carbon emissions than making a non-electric car. If everyone took buses, it would take forever to get anywhere. Buses aren’t desirable, they’re smelly and dirty. I don’t think anyone voluntarily takes the bus. If you had the money, you would buy a nice car too. There are a lot of problems presented in this video but not many realistic solutions. How do we convince people to give up their vehicles, but what’s in it for them? For a lot of people, a car is an absolute necessity. People need cars to go to work.

<p>
I agree that electric cars are not the sole solution to climate change and present their own environmental hazards and damages, however they are still an innovation that can help the climate crisis. While the production of electric cars may produce more CO2 than the production of gas cars, they last a very long time. Tesla batteries currently last up to 500,000 miles, and are expected to last up to 1 million miles in the near future. That is more than most people will ever drive in their life time. Barring any damage to the vehicle from accidents, buying an electric car can become the only vehicle purchase someone may make in their lifetime. That is a large improvement from the current model where people buy new gas burning cars every couple of years. It is unlikely that the culture of America will ever shift to a majority of travel being done on public transportation. Americans love the convenience of their cars, so the best option is to make the cars that people drive contribute less CO2.

This lecture truly showed that technology cannot answer every problem we blindly believe it can. As a whole, we are falsely guided to believe that the direction we are headed is better than the one we are on, especially with more electric cars being made, however this is simply not true. I was shocked to hear how much CO2 is emitted just through the manufacturing of the car, somehow this fact had not even crossed my mind. The car companies that are falsely advertising their products will be the true harm to the future, because the people are oblivious that there is harm being caused at all.
<br><br>
I agree that this is also a structural issue, because many countries such as ones in the EU, are really good about using buses and trains because they're cities are built around this kind of transport system and it is normalized and "cool". I have family in Berlin, and whenever I go to visit them for a few weeks, I never use a car and it is somewhat refreshing, and fun even, to hop from train to train, not be sitting behind the wheel, and integrated into the community of people. You see people in suits, as well as even the homeless, sitting on trains together, but it's all normal, it's all seen as okay. I remember my grandparents telling me how much they calculated saving by not having cars, and what they have spent it on since then. It's not only benefitted the environment but also themselves. If people supported public forms of transport more, I believe more systems would be built in and it would be such a huge step to addressing the climate crisis.

<p>
This lecture was, to me, the most intriguing yet. I have never heard the perspective Ken has on electric cars, and it has definitely changed my viewpoint in regards to transportation. At home, I have a car and enjoy the freedom it gives me to travel. Because I live in a suburban area, there is not a subway system in place, although I wish there was. I used to take my car to school, every single day, after I got my license in high school. Although I have always been passionate about environmentalism, I never had a second thought about driving to school every day, or driving to get food or go to the beach with my friends. Watching this lecture, I’m reminded that transportation is yet another system that is slowly killing our environment. I am a first year at UCSB, and thus I don’t have my car here with me at school. In the beginning, this felt really weird to me, and I almost felt trapped on campus because I wasn’t able to just go out and drive whenever I wanted. In fact, I used to drive at home just to clear my mind or pass time when hanging out with friends when we would run out of things to do. In my time at UCSB, however, I’ve realized that driving is not a necessity, as I’ve gotten used to walking, biking, or taking the bus to wherever I need to go. I hope to carry on these practices at home, despite having a car available to me, because of the detriment that individual vehicles have on our environment. 
<br><br>
Ken brought up the amount of hours and energy put towards the creation and distribution of electric vehicles and how he sees this as a massive waste of time. Although I had never heard this perspective before, I somewhat agree, although replacing all gas-powered cars with electric would, in my opinion, be a huge win for environmentalism. The problem is that electric cars are not yet considered the norm, especially for people who can only afford older cars or cars that are powered by gas. Ken brings up a valuable point, however, that we must make changes in our society before any change can be made. I’m from Orange County, where many people are extremely focused on appearances or materialistic wealth. Although I can acknowledge that I am lucky to come from a place of privilege, I know that it would be extremely difficult to popularize public transportation in my hometown, because it is rarely ever used by most of the community. There is definitely a stigma, that I do not agree with or support, around using public transportation because many people use it by necessity and not for environmental reasons, which is extremely frustrating. I can only imagine the benefits our community and the environment would face if more people used public transportation instead of relying solely on their own vehicles. But this change, like Ken stated, must start with our own perceptions that society has embedded into us. There must be a massive change in how we view transportation for any changes to be made in regards to how we travel. This lecture has definitely inspired me and I am hoping to look into how my community at home can make the change to focusing on more environmentally-friendly means of transportation.
</p><hr>



<p>
This is the first talk that Ken gave that I mostly disagree with. I think he frames the problem simply and approaches a solution idealistically. His thoughts on electric cars in particular annoyed me seeing as how he trivialized the benefits that stem from them. Although it requires more CO2 to produce, an electric care will not produce small particle air pollution and offers a solution to a problem killing ten thousand humans yearly. As the technology and process get more efficient, this initial sunk cost in greenhouse gases will diminish
<br><br>
I think that these types of discussions are what further introduce a bias in people's minds regarding climate change. I'm referring in particular to the argument that cars are objectively bad and offering very poorly constructed solutions to solving the emissions that stem from their purchase and use. I think its hypocritical to say that humans don't need cars after talking about the huge expansion into suburbs that americans have led. In these cases, cars are a necessity, not a luxury. While I agree that reducing wasteful car use should be a priority, pitching cars as 'death traps' to do so is not the way to go by any means. It's a fact that vital locations exist a certain distance from us and the most viable way of reaching them is to drive.
<br><br>
I think the arguments would resonate with the reader if both the pros and cons of cars were mentioned. Appropriate solutions would be create more public transport means at lower costs that would be as convenient as driving and have cars as a back up for important matters.
</p><hr>



<p>
Throughout the course of the video, I couldn't stop thinking about why it's so difficult for us as a society to change to more public transportation heavy lives. For example, I've pretty much have always grown up taking the bus, train, skateboarding, or biking to school or wherever it is where I needed to go and in retrospect, most of the time when my mom would drive It would be to attend family events or go to work. On the other hand, I found it eye-opening how much tons of C02 it takes to create an electric car and how although it can be argued that they make up for it over time it's still something that can be replaced with public transport. I saw that one of my classmates mentioned how roads are much smaller in other parts of the world and it made me think about how many parts of LA would greatly benefit from more train stations and how it would greatly lower our carbon footprint as a city considering how much traffic builds up just to get 15 miles down the road. Owning cars as a societal status is also eyeopening because it sheds light on a lot of different LA cultures that I grew up around. From street racers, lowriders, to sports cars I've always seen these different types of cars as a staple for being apart of exclusive groups that always seemed to have their own special worlds to themselves. In the end, this lecture helped me put into perspective the amount of importance we place on cars as a cultural status display and how it would be more beneficial to use public transportation rather than owning our own car.

<p>
I have a ’95 Toyota Camry. I totally know that each time I use it, it’s not good. This class has made me acutely aware that my use of my car is contributing lots of greenhouse gas emissions into the environment, yet no matter how bad I feel about my actions, I keep doing them. I’m not proud. Trust me, I’m not proud. I’d like to stop but I feel like I’m trapped by the convenience it provides me. I’d love to stop spending 50 dollars every 2 weeks to by 14 gallons of gas. I’d love for that money to be safely situated in my bank account which so desperately NEEDS that money to not be going to gas, yet here I am. Still driving from downtown to school 5 days a week. I feel like the primary reason I don’t participate in mass transport offered in Santa Barbara, that being bus, is because of something pretty minor. Sleep. I am so so so so tired constantly. I’m stretched thin between work and trying to afford ren tand school (and GAS haha), doing homework, keeping my GPA at a reasonable enough and the mere idea of getting up an hour and a half earlier to get to class via bus is enough to shut down the entire notion. I want to stop doing that. I’ve decided I’m gonna try to revamp my old bike so that at bare minimum, I can bike to work if nothing else. If I can’t write the entire thing out of existence, the best I can do is minimize my impact my car causes.
</p><hr>



<p>
I do believe that cars are a major problem with the environmental climate crisis, and that mass transit as well as walking and biking would be massively helpful to the situation, I still am a bit skeptical on how realistic it would be to change the culture of our country more or less our world. Yes to the average 20 to 30 year old this all seems realistic because most people at those ages are close to the city center, not being married or having children. They can get to their job everyday, but how will their children get to school. Where I lived in my hometown, biking every day to school would take a little over an hour. Double that and make it two, there and back. The idea is that mass transit and minimalism would save us time as well as money, but I feel as though that is only looking at the small scale picture. Also, with the suggestions of getting rid of cars and switching methods of transit, that would lead to more dense city populations. The denser that city populations become, the more crime that occurs as well spread of disease. The one thing that I think needs to be looked into more is the effect of certain proposed measures on society as a whole, rather than just the individual. Because honestly, I feel as though Ken you give us a lot of very strong points, but sometimes it feels as though we are looking at this through a very robotic view point, not giving an in-depth bigger picture.

I agree with Ken’s idea that cultural change holds a higher importance than technological innovation in combatting the climate crisis. Firstly, technological innovation can only be effective if it is culturally and politically “accepted.” I back this argument by identifying how political objection to climate change has inherently halted progressive technological innovation by creating a predetermined cultural fate and inevitable reliance. For example, the political decision to remove the rail system due to the invention of the interstate system, established a societal “need” and reliance on the automobile industry. Additionally, destroying the rail system terminated the potential rail system of highspeed trains that could’ve mirrored the well-developed rail network of Europe. Instead, it created a cultural dependence on cars, with the idea that we “need” them. Furthering and promoting the idea of one car per person signifies convenience and freedom. The automobile and oil industries continue to further the consumeristic mindset of America through political power. Similarly, in the late 1970’s, President Carter had solar panels installed on the White House, to further his efforts and campaign on conserving energy. However, the solar panels were quickly torn down once President Reagan took office, a supporter of the free market and oil industry. Decades later, President Obama reinstalled the solar panels onto the White House, focused on the climate crisis, signed the Paris Accord, and implemented environmental policy. However, in opposition, President Trump rolled back most of the environmental policies implemented by Obama, withdrew from the Paris Accord, and has focused on promoting the coal and fossil fuel industries. Thus, showing how the political agenda impacts technological innovation, as well as impacting societal perception. Scientists have known about the impacts of climate change for decades, yet political opposition has been able to culturally manipulate the reality by establishing societal dependence on industries. Cultural change is highly dependent on the political agenda of our political leaders. As a result, technological innovation and political decisions tend to parallel the wants and needs of the industries that fund our political leaders and hold economic importance in our country. Ultimately, politics unilaterally determine societal and cultural needs by creating a reliance on our outdated innovations and outdated industries.

I found this lecture extremely interesting. My family recently acquired an electric car and my father is extremely proud of the fact that it does not pollute as much as a normal car. He gets excited about finding different routes that allow him to stop and charge the car and is impatiently waiting for more fast charging stations to be placed in parking garages. I will feel extremely guilty having to inform him that his environmentally friendly electric car actually eats up the amount of carbon emissions ideally emitted each year (sorry for the awkward wording). What is really unfortunate about having to tell him this is the fact that, given where my family lives (in a small town that requires us to drive 45 minutes to get to a small city to retrieve certain necessities), there are very few alternatives to having a car.
<br><br>
 In the lecture, Ken touched upon the fact that having a car is considered “cool” or “freeing” in society and that people in the fields of sociology and psychology would have to find a way to figure out why it was viewed this way and how to discourage this view. For me, the most obvious reason that owning a car is cool/freeing is because it allows you to get to where you want to go almost immediately. You are not hindered by stops as you would be on a train or bus, and, though with a car you can be slowed by traffic, you do not have to deal with other strangers being close to you. Your car is (or has the potential to be) clean, fast, and not dictated by the needs of others. However, if there were more trains and buses that had a more complete reach between towns and cities I do think that more people would convert to public transportation. I know many people who avoid public transportation because it is crowded and can take longer due to stop delays. Implementing more buses and trains could potentially combat these problems and make people more willing to ride public transportation.
<br><br>
* On a side note there is an interesting episode on public transportation on the show The Patriot Act (on Netflix), it explains how attempts to build more public transportation has been combated by the fossil fuel industry and the Koche brothers who want people to continue to use cars.

I appreciate that the best way to meet our climate goals is to cut usage of motorized vehicles entirely, but I can't recognize how it is possible. The world will halt as we know it, and even if we ween the usage of motorized vehicles, there is no way we can possibly support the population without transportation of goods and services. The production of a vehicle is an abhorrent contribution to climate pollutants as it is, but I believe we still must try to get everyone to drive electric vehicles, but produce the materials and energy responsibly. I know this is not a modest ask, but we can't stop the world from turning entirely by just eliminating the use entirely. We certainly should limit the use of cars, and the ownership of them to necessity alone. We should also transition as much as possible to public transportation, trains, buses and carpooling, but it wont be an immediate transition. 
<br><br>
I really appreciate the idea of the social change before technological. Like the film Minimalism, we need to reduce our consumption first by changing the culture around having so much stuff. This will drastically reduce climate pollution. We need to work towards clean sustainable energy and producing cars without such a carbon footprint, but cars are going to be forever likely unless trillions are poured into public transportation that gets everyone where they need to go to make the world go round.

In the lecture, I am completely shocked at how destructive electric cars are for the environment. I always believed that they were beneficial to the planet, releasing low amounts of carbon dioxide in the air. They are advertised to be "eco friendly" on many platforms of social media, encouraging people to transition to using electric cars. What I didn't know was how destructive it was to the environment to produce these cars. 
<br><br>
Capitalism thrives of false advertisement and fake news. They target the sensitivities of people and will do whatever it takes to make profit.

In Professor Ken's video "Why the climate crisis is a cultural problem," It's surprising to realize that electric cars produce more carbon than regular cars. Reengineering the cultural practice of car use is an efficient way to stop the carbon level from increasing. Car is deeply rooted in our culture that many people cannot live a life without them. The negative impacts of excessive car usage are obvious, not only the casualties from car accidents, but also the increasing amount of carbon it produces in our atmosphere. As human beings, we should change our lifestyle by adapting to public transportation. The less carbon we produce, the brighter the future for our future generations.

The symbolism behind owning a car for a 21 century teen living in North America is the transition from childhood to adulthood. I know almost all my friends were asked the question: What car do you want for your birthday? Even I was asked this question before the legal driving age. A car from your parents symbolizes their congratulations on your coming of age. Although coming of age should be celebrated, people, both kids and their parents, should be more informed and be conscious of the underlying dangers and threats this gift poses on the environment. I remember just a few years ago, my best friend and I would joke around and call ourselves peasants whenever we had to ride the bus because either of us passed our road test. Looking back, I realized that calling ourselves peasants had a social connotation that came with not owning a car. However, after educating myself on the climate crisis, I feel empowered everytime I opt out a car for a bus, knowing that however small I may be, I do have a say in stopping climate change.

The history of automobile culture and popularity was really eye-opening and explanatory for me. It always confused me why cities like LA had such mediocre public transportation systems, why people kept buying more and more cars when every single person I grew up around complained about the horrible 405 traffic (because of all the cars). Why hadn't we put money and energy into developing more metro lines and given up the trendy Prius a long time ago when there are so many drawbacks to having a car? Like Ken said, cars are the reason for an immense number of deaths every year. They are a huge investment and getting increasingly expensive. The U.S.'s history with wartime industrial manufacturing and the overall cultural focus on suburbia explains this phenomenon. It is really shameful that our obsession with cars has led to this becoming a problem in other countries. It makes me wonder how our role in world politics and culture will change or should change as we are not the leading player in all the important aspects. I was taught growing up that public transportation was dirty, unsafe, inefficient and lacking. My family, like most others, took immense pride in their cars: a scratch or an accident to a car was like the end of the world. However, after seeing cities like Japan and Paris that function entirely on public transportation, and living for months without using a car and instead biking, riding the metro, or walking, I understand that this is not acceptable. Sure, the public transportation around LA and SB don't compare to these other cities, YET. We may be leading in the spread of consumption of automobile culture but we are dismally behind in infrastructure, urban planning and funding for public transport. Even from a non-environmental standpoint, cars are not a sustainable way to get people around. Anyone from LA will tell you that.

Before watching the lecture “Why the climate crisis is a cultural problem,” I believed that we can change our future by technological innovation, which could help us solve the climate crisis. But after watching this lecture, I changed my attitudes toward this issue. Professor uses statistics and examples to supports his opinions. If we want a healthy planet, we should emit no more than two metric tons of CO2 or equivalent per year. Unfortunately, a typical car in the United States emits about 4.6 metric tons of CO2 per year. Cars are necessary to us, so the hope that we don’t drive cars were gone. But with the rise of the population, the car use would only be more severe than now. So, we should change our cultural problem. Why cars are cool, but buses are not? If everything else were equal, switching from car to bus could reduce our individual climate footprint. However, with fewer than 5 percent of Americans taking the bus to work. If we could change people’s attitudes toward this question, it could be easier to let us protect the environment, even though this, not an easy task. Also, we do not have time to hope and wait someone shows up and help us change the climate crisis. 
<br><br>
Sometimes I think change the climate crisis is not a difficult task if everyone living on the planet believe it and decide to change the situation. But the reality is, a lot of people don’t believe this, or they don’t want to give up the staff they have.

It is true, the age of gas cars is over. But the age of electric cars I feel has the most potential of all forms of transportation. The reason I say this is because the introduction of autonomous vehicle software. Culturally, we believe in the idea that "time is money" and as such, the reason why cars are so appealing is that they can get us to where we need to go in the least amount of time. With autonomous vehicle software, we can now have driverless (zero-emmision) cars circulating around the city ready to transport people to their location at the press of a button. This idea is very promising as it would not only reduce carbon emissions per person per car, but it would also have people own less cars as they can cheaply ride these vehicles instead. It also solves the issue of spending massive government funds on building infrastructure to support public transportation such as subways and trains. And even for people who decide that they do want a personal car, they can have the car autonomously transport other people to their destinations while the car owner is at work as was proposed by Tesla last year (https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/22/tesla-plans-to-launch-a-robotaxi-network-in-2020/). This again would spread out the carbon emissions per capita and would make an electric car much more economical and greener. Finally, the exciting thing is that this technology is not far away at all. Companies such as Uber, Lyft, Google, Tesla, GM, etc. are all rushing to develop enhance autonomous driving software so they can get their driverless taxis on the road (https://qz.com/1789097/gms-cruise-reveals-its-driverless-shuttle-to-replace-the-car/). Electric cars have an exciting future ahead and have the potential to be a faster, more accessible, less costly, and greener form of transportation than the currently available public means that we see today.

This video was very eye-opening because I have always assumed that a more fuel-efficient car is better and switching to electric cars will be a huge help to slowing down the climate crisis. It never really occurred to me that much better public transportation would provide the greatest impact despite knowing its likely better than driving everywhere. It makes me wonder if the automoblie industry has something to do with unkempt public transportation systems even today. If it was made to be a lot better and more convenient, there would be less of a need to have cars, or at the least use them as much as we do currently. Another surprising fact was how we work a day a week just to afford a car, when one of the most common uses of a car is to go to and from work. I think the idea of being able to retire that much earlier in our lives would be huge for most people, especially being able to use the money you would spend on a car and put it into retirement.
<br><br>

This ties in with the short films assigned for the week because of their focus on less intensive activities to achieve life satisfaction. With so much more time in one's life devoted to doing what they love to do without being drowned out by having to work all week, people could center their focus on what they can provide others, for example sharing harvested garden foods, making clothes, etc. and bond with them over similar interests. This in turn would lessen people's need to find satisfaction in buying things they don't need to have a temporary feeling of happiness.

I find it interesting that Ken talks about cars as something appealing that countries that didn't have cars before would want to have cars now. Is it not that these countries were colonized and forced to think their ways are "barbaric" and "backwards". Is it not that Westerners forced many developments onto countries that were fine before imperialist western countries. If westerners could just live with themselves without feeling the need to build an empire and "own" as much countries as possible, then people could simply just share what they have developed and see if other people want it instead of forcing it onto them by calling them underdeveloped. Of course it is convenient to transport that way, but this way of thinking is interesting to say the least. 
<br><br>
I think rethinking car use is a good call. This reminds me of what the University of California is doing in terms of emission reduction - offsets. Offsets are actually tough cases to follow because, if UC decided to buy a piece of land (again ownership) to plant trees to offset its emissions, then it gives UC the "good feel" that UC is doing something "good" and can continue to emit more CO2 because it can buy offsets. But what about the indigenous folx living on those lands? They are then displaces and removed to somewhere else. Much like all of the National Parks of USA, as an activist like to say, "National Parks are colonial theme parks!" 
<br><br>
We cannot exclude poc, black/brown folx, and indigenous folx from these conversations.

<p>
Ken, I fully support the idea that we need less cars on the road, and we need it now, but I don't think your argument really validated the complexity of this issue.
<br><br>

My partner is visiting this weekend from Ohio, and putting aside the issue of air travel, I'm going to have to drive through the night to see her. There aren't trains and buses that will take me where I need to go, in enough time to stay the night with her. I'm not the only person who has loved ones living places public transportation can't access well. I can't imagine not seeing the love of my life for two years. 
<br><br>

It takes five minutes to drive from my house in the bay area to my school, it takes the crowded bus an hour. If I wanted to bike to my first job in high school, it would have taken three times as long as it took to drive, in crowded and dangerous traffic, and I would have had to get up before dawn. Those both would have been cheaper options, and much better for the environment, but bicyclists are at a much higher risk of injury and death than motorists, and the bus would have taken two hours out of my day, every day. 
<br><br>

I understand cars are killing the planet, and I've used mine a total of once this quarter. I'm not advocating for cars here. But your economic equations (at least what you express in the lecture) aren't taking the whole picture in perspective. Public transport is a LOT slower in some places, and it can make finding and keeping jobs a lot harder. Some people can't walk well. Some people are worried about taking public transportation alone. I am not a car fan, but we need massive industrial change to make public transport viable for the majority of the country.

This lecture expresses the reality of technology not being the solution to the climate crisis. Ken gives the perfect example by discussing something that I’m sure everyone is interested in, automobiles. Many people my age can’t wait to get their first car and go out for a spin, but we fail to realize just how much we affect the environment directly and indirectly with our vehicles. We fail to realize that even if we are using electric cars, we are still greatly contributing to the climate crisis. I was very surprised to hear that the production of one car releases two metric tons of CO2. This is not including how much CO2 it emits when using the car. Though electric cars are better in the long run, we can’t even afford the emissions that we would create by simply producing them. It is important for us to stop the use and buying of cars and start to use public transportation instead. This is a change that we MUST make, but I really doubt that people are going to be willing to give up their cars. I know people who really like their cars and are always looking to tune them up so it would be difficult to get people like them to give up driving. The chances of this cultural change occurring are very slim.

<p>
I think Ken is absolutely right because I’m a car lover but because that’s what I was brought up on from my dad. He showed me cars and I fell in love with them but he was my dad if he would’ve showed me that buses or trains were cool and took me on them as a kid I’d most likely perform that sort of transporting  over cars. Now that I’m aware of the disastrous consequences of cars towards the planet I’ll make sure to show my kids if I have any a different sort of transportation to lessen emissions and I’d encourage others to do as well with next generation.
</p><hr>



<p>
Before watching this video, I was set in the fact that everyone should try to make the shift towards electric cars. I didn't account for the fact that the production of these technologically advanced cars does emit roughly 22 metric tons over the span of 11 years, which is problematic given that we can only emit 2 metric tons per person in order to keep global warming to the 1.5 degree C that we want to. Though the statistics and the reasons in this video were very compelling, I just have a hard time being optimistic that a culture change that Ken mentioned we need to dearly will actually occur. It is every 16 year olds dream to get a car once they are of age and personally, I want to save up for a nice one myself. I think in addition to our love for cars, the reason we love them so much is because they make our life faster. Just like how social media reduces our attention span and finds of craving more information in a faster, more concise way, I think cars are a physical representation of how transportation is the same thing -- we want to fastest way to do something for our desire to speed things up. This go go go lifestyle is quite toxic objectively, and it's something that I am guilty of, but I find myself not want to give it up. I also think the solutions of using more bus and train transportation is great, but only in some areas. Like a train only works for long distances where I am from. 
<br><br>
I completely agree that in an ideal world, the steps of switching to public transportation is what is needed. I just don't know how we can get there. I'm glad I attend UCSB where a bike is my main mode of transportation anyways. I'm curious to see if there are some laws or institutional changes that Ken may have that might help to make this shift on a more drastic level.
</p><hr>



<p>
The idea of a social or cultural switch is key. We in the US like our individual freedom of driving wherever we want whenever we want. I have my own car and love that freedom, however it is obviously extremely unsustainable. In order to be successful in moving our society away from cars for each person, we are going to need a way more expansive transportation system. In the US our system is expensive, overly time consuming and has minimal coverage. Due to this, depending on your lifestyle it can be very very difficult to not have a car in the US, especially in California. In my experience traveling in other countries, each country has subways trains and buses that are cheap, often subsidized by government, far reaching and therefore used by a huge part of the community. This is the direction in which we need to go. The issue with China and India gaining desire for individual cars is due to their wealth rising. As people make more money, they want their own vehicle as a symbol of freedom. That too is a social norm that needs to be changed in order to move into the right direction. Interesting statistic that case cost 9k a year and that if that went into retirement we could retire 20 years earlier. We are a society driven by instant gratification so a car is more appealing to us.

<p>
After watching the lecture video, I am shocked by how using cars as transportation from place to place actually causes so many emissions and unnecessary factors to the issue of the climate crisis. Studying in the United States, I have discovered how cars bring people convenience and efficiency. This further proves the fact that cars are cool and are considered the best option of transportation for Americans. From my perspective, it’s because of the huge area of land the US possesses that leads to this problem in which automobiles have become more and more. In contrast, in my home country Taiwan, residents mostly take buses or metros to workplaces or schools. Since we have a small area of land, people can also walk from place to place within a short period of time. Therefore, it not only does not make people feel worried about the inconvenience of transporting from one place to another but also bring less pollution, or in other words, carbon emission, to our earth. 
<br><br>
Furthermore, this cultural practice that Ken mentioned should be changed will definitely still be a perplexing problem. Although the experts try to convince people using massive transportation for alternatives, people who already get used to driving to work or school will still be doing the same thing. However, I believe if one person changes, people will naturally be influenced by their surroundings. Hence, it’s vital to be aware of the facts and statistics that are truly proved in our real lives and make a change from me first.

I agree with your comment that driving a car is a significant deal in the states as the vehicle is more convenient to travel long distances between place to place. However, if people live in the city, such as New York or Seattle, people tend to use public transportation as it is the most convenient way for their circumstances. Besides, as a UCSB student, we can barely go anywhere instead of having a car, so this issue also depends on the area where people live. Yes, we need to find ways to convince people using mass transit rather than owning several cars. Additionally, I think that more and more individuals are willing to take action.

A lot of which was said in Ken's lecture are facts that I often overlooked or have failed to realize. Here I am, thinking that electric cars will be the future of transportation and would immensely help reduce carbon dioxide emissions, all while completely ignoring the production process and the great amount of emissions it would release alone. I've never thought that owning a car would be considered as partaking in a certain culture, but now that Ken has mentioned it I can't help but realize how oblivious I have been. Pretty much everything we own and everything we desire to buy is thanks to the American culture. The excessive consumption of meat, the desire to own the latest technology and the impulse to buy designer clothes all play a huge role in this culture, and we only have ourselves to blame. We are all inclined to feel like we belong, to feel like we are finally a part of something "cool." Well if only many social media influencers and other renowned stars were smart enough to advocate and recommend public transportation, then the general public would be quick to jump on the bandwagon only to gain acceptance by people they highly value. The fact that it takes people to think something is "cool" in order to change for the better is astonishing and just goes to show that we as a whole have yet to develop the maturity necessary to combat the climate crisis. 
<br><br>
The advancement of technology has evidently brought nothing but trouble upon us, and as innovation progresses we will likely run into more obstacles and issues. While the use of technology certainly makes everyday tasks easier to accomplish, we shouldn't have to rely on it because it will eventually malfunction, then what? Buy a new product? Then we are back to square one. That being said, new innovations will continue to change our lives whether we'd like to acknowledge it or not. The only way for us to actually combat the climate crisis is by changing our way of living, which really doesn't take much and could be beneficial in many other ways (i.g. riding a bicycle to work could result in health benefits). All it takes for us is to realize that being "cool" isn't going to keep us on this planet for the long run.

While I understood that cars were bad for the environment, I did not realize how bad the process for making them was as well. I felt very hopeful when electric vehicles became a thing but I did not account that their process also releases an immense amount of CO2. Growing up in Los Angeles, I've learned how essential cars are to live there. Despite my friends and I living in the same city, it would take 30 minutes of driving just to hangout. Traffic is terrible, but walking and taking the bus also did not seem like an option. While it is environmentally friendly, cars are unfortunately more convenient, accessible, and will not make you late. While our metro system has a pretty organized schedule, it will still encounter the same traffic because of the amount of people driving and with new transportation methods like uber/lyft. 
<br><br>
When it came to cars, I had a hard time imagining life without them until I moved to Isla Vista. Moving here, I was so unfamiliar with being in a place where everything and everyone was just around the corner. It was like moving into an alternate universe where bikes, skateboards, scooters, and walking was the main and only method of transportation. While I do care for the environment and try my best to help alleviate the climate crisis in small ways, cars never seemed like an option. Before moving to Isla Vista, cars were too ingrained into my way of living. Knowing this, I completely agree with the student that Ken mentioned in this video, "what we need is not a hundred mile per gallon car but rather for taking the bus to become cool and owning a car to be anything but.." In this sense, I think our society needs to adapt to ways that make the bus systems more efficient rather than driving. I think the biggest advantage that cars have over public transportation is its accessibility and promptness. But if our culture is able to develop a way that makes buses or taking the train the better option in terms of getting from point A to B, I truly think people would make the switch. New York is a good example of exactly that. It is also a large city, but their culture has made it so that the subway and walking be the main method of transportation. Not everywhere is like Los Angeles or Isla Vista, but I think their differences emphasize the fact that people can live a life away from cars if we create ways that encourage buses or walking and make it more convenient.

In my ES 1 class, the professor mentioned that our society has been raised to believe that innovation is an inherent and unquestionable good. Believing that inventions such as the electric cars will be able to bring us out of the climate crisis is flawed because it causes us to focus on the new and shiny objects coming out rather than trying to fix what we have currently, such as infrastructure. Yes, affordable electric cars could help to reduce emissions over time, but something that could perhaps help even more is a more reliable public transportation system.
<br><br>
A big problem in the US is how inefficient our public transportation is. Because of how long it takes to wait for buses that come once an hour in certain cities, it is more efficient just to have a car or use Uber and Lyft instead for many people. As brought up in the video, this is due to reduced funding for public transportation over time in order to make the idea of owning a car more appealing. I have personally been told that the MTD bus system for UCSB is much more efficient than other parts of California, and there are certain problems with the bus system as is. I agree with the points brought up in the video, but as is, the public transportation system needs massive overhauls before more people get on board with switching over their lifestyles.

Before watching this lecture, I was one of many people who believed that technological innovation could help to deal with the climate crisis. However, after watching this video, which provides a lot of statistics, my view has changed, which supports the argument that the climate crisis is a cultural issue. I'm not surprised, but one of the many facts that impresses me is that "the United States accounts for 4% of the world's population, and cars account for a quarter of the world's population.". What does this mean? First of all, I think it shows the backwardness of the public transportation system in most parts of the United States, as well as the extremely luxurious consumption concept and automobile culture of Americans. Reducing the carbon dioxide emission of single car does not solve the problem of car pollution. However, enterprises are still producing more "low carbon dioxide emission" cars. On average, 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide are emitted each year after automobile manufacturing. Our goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5-2 degrees Celsius will require us to emit up to 2 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. Making these cars requires about 2 metric tons of carbon dioxide, which is our annual emissions, excluding food, housing and clothing.
<br><br>
I'm a petrol head. I like big displacement cars very much, but I believe that electric cars will be the future development trend because they are more in line with people's life style and they are more friendly to the environment.

I had just finished watching the Super Bowl, or rather the Super Bowl commercials, when I decided to watch this video. I was taken aback while watching the Super Bowl when I saw a commercial for the new electric Hummer vehicle that will be be available starting in 2021. I saw several positive reactions to the advertisement of this new vehicle on social media as electric cars have been praised for their solution to the climate crisis as Ken suggests in this video, while the production behind them has often been overlooked. I was aware that Hummer stopped the production of its vehicles due to the excessive emissions the large vehicles had, but never saw them coming back onto the market with the solution to their issue being an electric vehicle. After viewing both Ken’s video and the Hummer Super Bowl commercial I now have a completely different outlook on the entire situation… I do not see Hummer’s decision to create an electric vehicle as any sort of solution since producing such a large vehicle would likely emit just as much CO2. Looking at the situation in a more optimistic sense, Hummer has taken a step in the right direction and I think that sacrificing the size of their famous vehicle would be a wise next step to take. I am interested to see if in the future the desired car size changes as more and more people are exposed to the harm inflicted upon the environment due to car manufacturing.

I agree with Ken, the climate crisis is a cultural problem. While technological developments seem like an easy fix changing our society’s values and culture is ultimately more effective and less time consuming. Like Ken said, we really do not have the time to hope and wait for someone like Elon Musk to put a bandaid on the climate crisis. 
<br><br>
It is up to humanity to change. As an environmentalist is is sometimes defeating to realize that while I may be trying to make better consumer decisions that cause the least amount of harm to the environment others simply do not have this environmentally conscious instilled in them. Therefore, it is up to us to educate others on what is truly valuable like nature, We must stop putting a price on it and realize that Earth and its resources are priceless and many of its resources are finite and will eventually run out. 
<br><br>
Overall, I appreciated this approach to defeating the climate crisis because it is such a simple fix in theory that does not involve advanced technology but instead it requires a simple shift in mentality.

<p>
In hindsight, I am now realizing how many of my past environmentally destructive tendencies were culturally based. I remember being 16 in high school and couldn’t wait to be able to drive and get my first car. It was a normalized milestone, yet environmentally degrading. I found Ken’s insight on electric cars especially interesting because Priuses and Teslas have a reputation of being more eco-conscious, however, it’s a total luxury to be able to buy one. Now knowing that these electric cars are actually not as sustainable as we think, it almost seems like it’s just for show - to say “look at me, I’m environmentally-conscious” when in reality, the most sustainable thing to do is not purchase a car at all. Admittedly, I have a car (not electric) and enjoy the luxuries of being able to hop in and pull up to anywhere I want, but now that I’m in this class, I’m seriously questioning my car use and thinking ahead about where I will live in the future and if it’s easily accessible to public transportation. Since I’ve been at UCSB though, I can say I’ve been driving much much less compared to living at home in the Bay Area which is refreshing. Apart from the environmental effects, Ken details other burdens that come along with owning a car. It’s expensive to own a car after you add up the cost of the car itself, insurance, gas, and all of the other maintenance expenses that come along with owning a car. Along with expenses, it’s a high-risk activity and can cause fatal accidents. 
<br><br>
Because cultural influences have a strong effect on climate, we can work to reverse these normalized destructive activities and work to make sustainable things “cool.”

<p>
Surprisingly, after watching "Why the Climate Crisis is a Cultural Problem", I actually felt hopeful. I completely agree with Ken that we cannot engineer our way out of this crisis, but we as consumers can become more conscious about our actions and work to reduce emissions/waste. Obviously, the United States and other developed countries have a long way to go to achieve a minimalistic lifestyle, but significant changes are already being made. Sustainable choices such as buying clothes secondhand, shifting to a vegetarian/vegan diet, and living in urban areas with superior public transport are becoming desirable and the "cool" thing to partake in. Ken stated many times that in order to stop people from buying cars, public transport needs to become the "cool" method of transportation, and I find that attainable. As more and more people grow aware of the climate crisis that we are in, they will realize the changes that need to happen to save our planet and will willingly want to make said changes; and if people won't want to, they eventually will have to...

<p>
Despite cars contributing to the climate crisis, I do not think that the use of cars will ever be reduced without cultural changes. One way of thinking about this, is that people find their cars to be "cool," as was noted in this video. Cars are perceived to be part of how people fit into society based on the qualities and model of their car. Public transportation to these people who admire their cars, does not seem like a possibility, sometimes due to their preference for the more so called "efficient." This view, of owning a car and finding it cool has been a thing for decades now, as we have seen in this video. Following the Great Depression, and new technological innovations that occurred afterwards, people were into the idea of owning a car, or sometimes two. Thus, the carbon foot print due to the use and production of cars is a cultural problem that can only be dealt with by changing the way we get to places. Using cars has become a cultural issue and will continue to be one if the transition to other forms of transportation is not adapted. 
<br><br>
To summarize, this video led me to reflect on how there can be change if there is a cultural shift. A cultural shift can be possible, if people were to consider the possibilities of taking alternative transportation systems to work or school. The way to have change is to act and adapt to new ways rather than sticking with what we think is "cool." I think that what we might think of as "cool" has resulted in catastrophic consequences, that have not only harmed one country, but continue to destroy the planet as a whole.

<p>
In the lecture, "Why the Climate Crisis is a Cultural Problem" and the problems of electric cars, I was completely shocked by the fact that  an average mid-range car takes 17 metric tons to produce while a high-end SUV, Range Rover for example, takes 35 metric tons. As learned in this lecture, one person should only be contributing 2 metric tons of CO2. This is already completed just by purchasing a car alone. As said in the video, you’re already meeting this number just by having the car parked not including actual usage and clothes, food, etc. This clearly shows electric cars will do very little justice in helping combat climate crisis. 
<br><br>
Another fact that I found astonishing is that within 15-20 years, the amount of cars in the world will double to 2 billion. This is completely outrageous as it is unimaginable to think of how much CO2 this will be alone not counting everything else like major fossil fuel industries. The solution for many scientists is obvious, we must stop using motored vehicles, but our worldwide population has quickly gotten used to utilizing a car to get wherever they need to go.

Watching this video reminded me of the Netflix show “Patriot Act” hosted by comedian Hasan Minhaj especially the fast fashion episode and the consequences of this industry. One of the many visuals from the show that I thought of while watching Ken’s video was the statistic that every year an average American will throw away 80 pounds of clothes and even organizations such as the Salvation Army will throw away around 18 tons of unwanted clothes every three days. American culture is now a culture that creates waste and contributes to the climate crisis; it’s disgusting to think about. Our materialistic and consumerist culture makes our carbon footprint and greenhouse emissions so easy to increase. Just because the consequences of wasting or throwing away a shirt that was poorly made in a cheap sweatshop doesn’t directly affect a person doesn’t mean that the consequences won’t happen at all. Fast fashion, the primary topic of the episode, was shown to deplete so many resources such as wood and even deplete an entire forest just for 30% of the resources to go to fibers while the 70% that was left was thrown away. It’s devastating that an industry that is so economically prosperous could ruin our earth and our chances of tackling the climate crisis issue.
<br><br>
I didn’t know until watching Ken’s video that even though electric cars are advertised to reduce an individual’s carbon footprint, the process of manufacturing the cars contribute just as much as driving around a normal fuel-powered car. The thought never occurred in my mind, I would always assume that once a car is built as a hybrid, it would reduce emissions. But I was wrong. Having a car is viewed as an “important” investment and when Teslas or any hybrid cars came out in the market, I thought “oh those cars may be worth buying”. Californians, like myself, will find that cars are a must-have in a person’s everyday life. But compared to New Yorkers, the system is built (maybe not so well but the resources are available) allowing people to utilize public transportation.

I agree with you. Cars have been a major problem since they have become widely available and affordable to people since its release. Cities ,like Los Angeles, are facing a major air-quality issue with the city being surrounded by a cloud of smog. The problem with the smog is it created by anthropogenic ozone at the ground level—an unhealthy and dangerous pollutant. When dense major cities are overpopulated with People, industry and vehicles, smog is bound to be formed with nitrous oxide reacting with the volatile organic compounds. Knowing this, I am not surprised at the impact electric cars have on our environment despite claiming they are meant to help reduce our carbon footprint. Realistically, you can’t reduce your carbon footprint if you’re main mode of transportation is having a car. Mass consumerism is always going to impact the environment because of the mass production that needs to take place in order to maintain the consumers happy.

A few years ago my parents bought an electric car and I remember being very excited that they chose such an eco-friendly automobile. The first time I sat in it, I thought it was so cool and modern, and I remember my mom telling me how often people would come up to her on the streets, asking her about her car. Back then, very few people owned electric cars and every time I would see one in public, I would immediately feel proud of the owner for making such a positive impact on our environment. I was also really proud of my parents, who previously had not really cared about their carbon footprint, and totally neglected to acknowledge that one electric car would not make much of a difference, especially considering that my family already owned two other (conventional, gas-powered) cars. As the years went by, I realized that electric cars were probably not enough to make a big change, but I have to be honest, I had no idea how detrimental they really were. I don't know why, but I never thought about the production of cars and the CO2 emissions that went into it. Hearing Ken explaining that electric cars are actually worse for the environment - in terms of their production - than normal cars, fueled by gas, really shocked me. The fact that simply buying a car is equivalent to the maximum amount of emissions each of us is "allowed" to contribute makes me wonder why we haven't done anything against the huge automobile industry yet.
<br><br>
Yes, new tech innovations are amazing and will definitely help, but we simply cannot keep waiting for those inventions when we are literally destroying our planet in the meantime. We have to act now because we are running out of time. I believe that education is a big part of changing our mindset as a society. I, personally, had no idea how much CO2 is emitted by producing a car and I can't believe how ignorant I was in thinking that owning an electric car would be enough to make a huge difference. This is why we have to educate others on the reality of the situation. Many people merely don't realize how their actions are impacting the climate. I hope that in the future, we will come to terms with the fact that cars don't equal happiness, success or status. None of these things matter once our planet becomes inhabitable.

Like you, I also used to think that electric cars were going to be the pinnacle of modern, environmentally-friendly transportation. Although not a true electric car, I remember when people (including my own family) would rave about the Prius and how sustainable it was. Well now that I've watched this lecture, it's somewhat funny to look back and see how naive we once were. Not only does the production of a single electric car trump a traditional gasoline-powered car in terms of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, but the battery itself also has numerous environmentally unsustainable qualities to it that add to the electric car's ecological impact. The mining, processing, and waste of metals for the car's lithium batteries aren't sustainable. In fact, it only adds to the amount of fossil fuel emissions and usually leads to toxic runoff entering waterways and other crucial parts of our ecosystem. Additionally, it takes fossil fuels to provide electricity to power the batteries, which in a way is defeating the whole purpose of the electric car - to reduce CO2 emissions going into our atmosphere. Instead, I believe our planet as a whole needs to focus on public transportation that is not only sustainable but attractive enough that it convinces a car-owner to use it instead. Not only would it cut out nearly $9,000 worth of expenses per year, but it will also have other environmental, economic, and general benefits as a whole. I think this is much more relevant in large cities such as LA and more rural areas of the US, where the public transportation model is so poorly done that having a car is just another necessity.

As Ken mentions that electrical car is a solution to climate crisis, and I notice that there are many people in US start to drive electrical cars like Tesla, which is a pretty good phenomenon that more people become to realize the environment needs protection. A fact astonishes me is that “in China, there is a 10,000% increase in cars within three decades.” Indeed, there are really so many cars in China, and there is traffic everywhere, but I have never expected such a huge increase. Also, Ken’s student said “cars are really cool,” which leads to the fact that there are even more cars than license drivers in America. I just feel pity that why are some people willing to destroy the planet just because driving is cool??? There is absolute no necessary that one people buy so many cars because after all, the one can not drive them at the same time. I hope more people can realize that we should not waste so many resources to increase the greenhouse gases anymore.

Starting off with the conversation of car culture and car usage across the globe, it was almost devastating to hear that there are around 1 billion cars on the road right now, with an expected 2 billion to come sometime in the future. For me personally, before watching this video I never really understood a solution to this problem other than electric cars. I was one of the people who understood the new electric car technology as something that would be able to save us from 0 emissions of CO2. To me, it was almost so strange to hear that these vehicles are so utterly insignificant in the long run of trying to help the planet reduce its carbon emissions. It was so interesting to me to hear that while they are a good switch, they can bring several consequences. Our planet cannot become sustainable because of only technology, it needs to be a shared pact between individuals that know the planet is dying. To eliminate any sort of rising impact we have on the planet, the only solution would be an era of culture committed to cutting down on resources(like our cars). I was utterly shocked when ken stated that if you save $9,000 a year(starting in your early 20’s) by not driving a car, you would be able to retire 15-20 years earlier than most people. 
<br><br>
I thought that it was very informative to hear ken talk about how public travel and transit are great ways to reduce our carbon footprint by a large amount. I feel it is important to show the general public that the use of public transit can actually have benefits, such as less money spent on gas or less time driving to get important tasks done. Most importantly, it makes it easier for everybody to breathe cleaner air, and reduces our carbon footprints.
</p><hr>



<p>
I am astounded. Until now, the majority of statistics that Ken had discussed were either things I already knew, or based on things I already new. I had no idea how much the production of cars hurt the environment, and yet people are buying more and more cars every year, despite the increasing expense of cars. Why? 
<br><br>
I think the primary reason why cars have become so common is because of the accompanying clout that having a cool car gives you. Looking purely at economics, there is pretty much no reason to own a car, as Ken articulates, demonstrating that nearly a fifth of someone's income goes toward it. So, logically, another factor is at play somewhere that incentivizes people to buy cool cars, and again, Ken informs all of us that it is car culture. So, the culture surrounding cars has the effect of shifting the demand curve for cars by a lot. Not surprisingly, this parallels the cigarette yet again; both cause cancer, one to the user and one to the planet; both are/were perceived as cool. Even after the science showing the link between cigarettes and cancer, people still smoked them, people who believed in the science STARTED smoking them, for no other reason than they were cool and it portrayed some level of status that you could do something that so many famous people also did.

This lecture addressed something I had been wondering for a while. Several years ago, I saw an article in Popular Science magazine about a car powered by compressed air. It was being developed in India, with that market in mind. India overwhelmingly gets its power from coal. This was mentioned in the article; the author noted that this is primarily where the energy for compressing air would come from. Things like these and electric cars seem to be in some ways a pure novelty. This car could convince some people that they are helping the environment when they are actually wasting enough energy through the conversion process. Perhaps the worst part of this, as well as with electric cars is that in thinking that one is environmentally responsible by driving an electric car, they are less averted to driving altogether, and become complacent with their carbon emissions. Something that I was reminded by this lecture is that in order to save our planet we need to drastically cut down on transportation-related emissions and that simply doing better than we are doing now won't be nearly enough to slow down climate change. Individualism (Individual transportation) is a very American value and this will be difficult to change as well. Elon Musk, the face of the EV industry, is highly opposed to more efficient and environmentally conscious method of public transportation. In one well-publicized interaction, he made fun of a notable public figure (I forgot who) for suggesting that Elon's proposed underground highways were to be used for public transportation and dismissed the idea altogether. Like I said in my previous comment, changing people's attitudes towards driving and public transportation is a tall order, but achievable.

There needs to be drastic change in the way we view labor and transportation as we face climate change. The most environmentally conscious way to transport people is self-driving public transportation. It is very disappointing that electric cars still contribute so much to emissions. Many 'solutions' to climate related problems so often reveal themselves to ultimately be band-aids. Overall there is so much waste. As a civilization we do not use our resources efficiently. The numbers show that outright ditching certain actions will make the biggest difference in the long run. Changing our values to meet the needs of the time is something that Im sure will face opposition. It is so hard to buy in to a completely different way of life but we shouldn't view it as impossible, and if we don't change future generations will be truly forced to.

While this weeks lecture is very logical and sound, and the point made are good ones, production of cars causes carbon emissions, there is much waste from cars, and cars generally are around a quarter of a US individuals emissions, I believe Ken has generalized a little to much in some areas. While the production of many cars creates massive carbon emissions, there are some lesser evils including Tesla, which gains much of its gigafactory production energy from solar panels, and which currently has plans to charge superchargers with solar panels and store energy in Tesla battery packs. In addition, these cars can last roughly 400,000 miles, nearly twice the life expectancy of many internal combustion engine cars, meaning any carbon from production is spread out over an even longer period. In a similar aspect, the car I currently drive is a 1991 Mazda Miata, a car nearly 30 years old, far longer than Kens 11 year estimate. 
<br><br>
None of this argument is meant to be taken as disagreement, I entirely agree that cars are terrible for our atmosphere and try to drive as little as possible, but in almost thirty years my car has still racked up over 250,000 miles, meaning I have emitted a large quantity of carbon, and would have been much happier driving an electric car and emitting no carbon (I have solar off which my family charges our plug in prius). Other problems with cars can include waste or sale to purchase newer cars, personally I shall be buying used cars forever, as its more sustainable and in many cases more affordable.
 <br><br>
 However, I would not purchase any vehicle if some other form of transit, biking, walking, skatine, bus, or train, were available. I prefer walking or biking to driving if possible, as its saves me the trouble of searching for parking, buying gas or maintaining a car. The amount spent annually on cars buy most families is tremendous and terrifying, and I hope to never be a contributing factor to that statistic. I try to minimize my climate impact as much as possible, and appreciate Kens outlook on the subject.

Cars are a luxury item that a lot of people want to have. Having a car is now seen as a necessity. Getting rid of cars all together would be ideal but that is not going to happen anytime soon, Electric cars would be the way to go if people are going to buy a car. Even though making a car makes is not the best at all. Cars have become a necessity to many people. The first thing that people need to look at is how to make traveling on public transportation or car a better and more efficient way. If it is potentially doable like it is said then why hasn’t it been done yet. In theory all this would be a good option if people would look into making this possible. The theoretical idea of being able to travel from LA to New York with just a couple gallons of gas is astonishing.  But there is a lot against this, meaning big companies and industries that make their money off making cars or fossil fuels. The future of how we use cars needs to improve immediately because the climate crisis will only continue to grow.
</p><hr>



<p>
It seems to me that most technologies today is just a way for people to continue their lavish lifestyle more comfortably and more “eco-friendly”. Even if some people do believe that technology advancements can improve some current technologies, like reducing carbon emission, it will not change the way we behave, and all it does is to delay the inevitable. In The Uninhabitable Earth, Wallace-Wells also describes the Silicon Valley as the cult of technology. Small things like electric cars, big things like moving to Mars, they give people a false sense of security. We start worshipping technologies. But technology is still a product, it needs a market. In the many documentaries we have seen, the people who are ignorant, who are oblivious to the crisis at hand, and the people who are advocating for climate change hoax for personal gain are the people who are not willing to change no matter what the technology is. 
<br><br>
    Aside from the limited capabilities of technology, I am sure that many people are aware of renewable energy, or some trendy stuff like #Teamtree, but all of these are only going to make a minuscule impact on the ongoing climate change. However if we the people change fundamentally, the effect of billions of people can certainly make a much more significant impact. Technology only provides an option, we the people need to decide how to use them.

<p>
One thing I thought Ken would talk about in the video but didn't was the viability of buying used cars instead of a new car. Buying used is not only cheaper in most cases, but you forgo the carbon emitted from producing the car because the car is already produced. Even in the long run buying a used car, whether it be gas or electric, leaves a smaller carbon footprint than the carbon footprint of a new car, whether it be gas or electric. I think this is important because although public transportation leaves a very minimal carbon footprint per person, for some people it just isn't practical to use public transportation and absolutely need a car for transportation. On innovation, throwing innovation out as a solution to climate change is very shortsighted in my opinion. When whales were being hunted to near extinction to use their blubber for oil lamps, most people's solution to adapt to the limited remaining supply of blubber was to find a way to use blubber more efficiently and let the population of whales rise to sustainable levels, until kerosene came along. Often times there are unintended solutions to today's problems found through tomorrow's innovation that are worlds better than the solutions we currently find viable today and to look at what solutions we have possible today is a low-resolution view of today's problems.

Walking is healthy, biking is healthy, skating is healthy, sitting is not. Walking is clean, biking is clean, skating is clean, driving, is not. I don't know if it takes a STEM major to put two and two together on this one, but I think this is adding up to us doing our best to stay out of cars. 
<br><br>
On one hand, there are the benefits that come from moving yourself around with your own legs instead of just driving. First off: calfs, you'll look great. Second, you'll catch needed exercise as you walk around from place to place, where you will likely be stationary when you arrive. Walking around even lets you experience the outdoors on a much more intimate level than you can achieve through a car window. Not only is it good for you, but it is also good for everyone else. Staying out of your car and the car market greatly reduces your carbon footprint. By not owning a car, you are saving money, saving your health, and, not to sound too dramatic, saving the world. 
<br><br>
As far as innovations go, I think we need to focus on cultural innovations. We need to innovate new perspectives that make people more inclined to use public transit instead of their own personal vehicles. Switching the view on how we get around would eliminate the need for an amazing invention, and would allow some of our best vehicular minds to focus more on improving the efficiency of public transportation.
</p><hr>



<p>
After watching Ken's lecture, "Why the climate crisis is a cultural problem (and why electric cars are more trouble than good)", I found it shocking that electric cars are perhaps not as beneficial for fighting the climate crisis as I originally thought. Given how much CO2 is "released" when manufacturing a car, it seems the solution is to not buy a car at all. Cities like Los Angeles will have to drastically rethink their system, as currently, cars are by far the most common method of transportation. Los Angeles is just immensely spread out, very unlike ultra-dense cities like San Francisco. For people in LA to not buy cars, there needs to be a very efficient public transportation throughout the city. While there are some modes of transportation being built currently, for example Elon Musk's loop, they aren't being built for the sole purpose of fixing or rethinking Los Angeles' transportation system. Elon Musk's loop is being built mainly as a long distance transportation, like from Los Angeles to San Francisco.

<p>
A good point that was brought up was how in the past, most cars were only owned by Americans and Europeans, and that in turn influenced the rest of the world to buy cars. China, along with the rest of the world's increase in car production is alarming as one car is enough to max out a persons carbon emissions. Instead of leading the world to create unnecessary vehicles that burn more fossil fuels, first world countries should instead look for sustainable ways of transportation and encourage other countries to follow suit. The idea of privately owned vehicles should be changed to support of public transport rather than the promotion of new electric cars as the video states.
<br><br>
The car industry is a giant within the economy. Cars directly support huge corporations in fossil fuels, steel, and other resources. In order to change society's mindsets, much effort will have to take place to combat the cultural idea of owning your own car, I appreciate how in addition to listing benefits for the planet by not buying a car, the video also includes personal benefits. By promising things such as early retirement, people are way more likely to accept the idea of changing a large part of their lives. In order for any real change to come though, it must be initiated on a national level. Without the access to reliable and easy to use public transport, people will not be as willing to make the switch from private to public. The key to pushing this movement is to invest in alternative transportation methods that can efficiently carry the most people fo the least amount of resources.

I have very mixed feelings about this lecture, especially considering that we live in Isla Vista. I find it incredibly difficult if not impossible to go into the mountains to enjoy a hike via mass transit. On top of that, it takes twice as long to get from here to downtown SB on a bus, more expensive on the Amtrak, and three times as long by bike. That's one way down the 101. Going north is even worse. Trying to get to Capitan from Isla Vista, the equivalent distance takes an hour by bike, 16 minutes by car and lacks any routes by bus or transit. If even 10 miles in a country that spans 2,800 miles can be so difficult, it's no wonder that we line the streets of IV with seemingly more cars than people. Of course we don't have to commute to Miami every day and so biking 2,800 miles isn't something we have to be concerned about but many students work in downtown Santa Barbara and often, people enjoy activities like hiking, camping, rowing, exploring as nearby as lake Cachuma. So how are we supposed to enjoy the beauty of our "backyards" without enlisting our speedy tools? That is my first feeling. In a city like New York, or Los Angeles, or San Diego or San Fransisco, mass transit is a great idea and it should be used almost exclusively. The problems arise when those methods of transit are not safe or clean or efficient or cheap. 
<br><br>
When I lived in Korea, I had no problem living completely without a car. I could take the train to Seoul from Daejeon and often get there faster than if I were to have driven. The subways were cultural hubs and were extremely efficient and easy to use, even for someone who didn't speak the language. I could get virtually anywhere I needed to very cheaply. And I always respected and will always respect Korea for that. Come back to the US and the subways of New York are dirty and flood under heavy rain and smell of cigarettes and urine. The Los Angeles transit only sprawls from UCLA to Pasadena to Compton with any reasonable convenience. That's not to say that it doesn't reach farther, but more that where it does reach can be quite far from many communities that will undoubtedly find using a car faster, despite the absurd traffic. 
<br><br>
So as much as I wish it were about cool and not cool, there is systemic change that must occur too. Construction projects must be underway to make trains and railways and subways and bus routes more dynamic and encompassing. Companies cannot have the monopoly on transit, like Amtrak does. Prices must come down for them to compete with the apparent desirability of driving a personal vehicle that will take you exactly where one needs to go in a third the time. It is unfortunate that electric cars are not the silver bullet that people hoped they would be in regards to the carbon emission of their consumers but they must undoubtedly be better in the short and long term than gas cars. But I do concede and understand that mass transit is the best option and perhaps we can get to a place where we won't need personal cars.

As someone who grew up in a rural area, not having a car is really not an option. There is no public transportation available so if you want to go anywhere you have to drive. This coincides directly with what Ken discussed in an earlier lecture, that people must move to cities to reduce our carbon footprint. While I can see how this is a good idea, I cannot imagine ever living in a city. I grew up in a small town and it is what made me who I am, cities honestly terrify me. I wouldn't trade anything for the way I grew up; riding horses, working on a farm, and raising livestock. If I get the chance to raise a family, I want my kids to grow up the way I did. However with our current condition and the steps we must take to mitigate it, that just doesn't seem possible. This deeply saddens me. However, living in cities really is just a better idea. In order to fix the problem the US caused, the rural lifestyle must die out.

After watching this video a fact that surprised me is that a new car will only last on average 11 years on the road. And the fact that if you bought a car every 11 years and never drove it you have already exerted your allotted CO2 emissions for your lifetime. I believe cars in the US are so popular due to the size of our country. We will never rival countries like Germany where public transport is excellent simply due to the size and population of the US.

I had always believed the solution to CO2 emissions would be electric cars even if it meant CO2 was released into the atmosphere during the production of the car and its electricity. This video is eye-opening into making me realize that the solution truly is public transport. The fact of the matter is simply stated by the fact that a train can transport a person 750 miles on one gallon of gas.

I always knew that our use of cars was one of the biggest components of our carbon footprint. I was shocked to hear in this lecture that simply buying a car, before even using it blows through years of the allotted metric tons of greenhouse gases we can emit according to the Paris agreement if we are committed to keeping global warming under 2 degrees Celsius. Although electric cars emit half as much greenhouse gases as regular cars in their lifetime, this video also opened my eyes to the fact that they are more costly to produce in terms of greenhouse gas pollution. I think many people are conscious and worried about the climate ciris (at least I hope they are) and therefore move towards more sustainable energy, such as buying electric cars. But just like I was, I think many people would be shocked to discover how harmful they actually are to produce. Today and in the future, technologies will certainly reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases not just in terms of energy production but also in the production of all our materials, from cars to food. However, in my opinion, technology alone will not halt the rising CO2 levels before we suffer drastic consequences of climate change all over the world. As all of this week’s material shows, we will have to make personal changes to our lifestyle if we want to see a decrease in our greenhouse gas emissions, and attempt to keep the agreements made at the Paris climate conference in 2015.

It is absolutely infuriating how easy it is to emit CO2... these videos are making me more and more angry. I keep thinking I can lower my carbon footprint but then hear something like “even if you buy a car once every 11 years for life and don’t even drive it, you will have emitted all of your CO2 you should emit per year per safety standards.” Like what the fuckkkkkk. Excuse my language. But how can we address and correct the climate crisis, especially during this crucial moment in time when we’re at risk of creating irreversible damage to our planet, when it is so easy to emit such high amounts of CO2 with little effort? Everyone just needs to 1. Go vegan. 2. Take the bus. 3. Invest in clean, renewable energy sources. 4. Thrift shop. 5. Live minimalist. 
<br><br>
This class is so infuriating, but is such a necessary course for everyone at UCSB to take. We NEED to know this information that we don’t hear about in mainstream news media. Thank you Professor Hiltner for really opening my eyes to the significance of the climate crisis.

Before watching the lecture Prof.Ken presented, I was full of hopes that we could count on technology as a way to improve the climate change. But the video turns out I was totally wrong. Prof.Ken utilizes the use of automobile as an example to prove that even with the rise of technology, the problem of climate change will still escalate if we refuse to make change in our daily llfe style. At the beginning of the lecture, Prof.Ken did an arithmetic about the amount of CO2 that manufacturing a car will emit and presents us that “a manufactured car is already equivalent to releasing two metric tons of CO2”, which is an absolutely astonishing number since that number has already reached the maximum amount of emission we can contribute to control the temperature rise within 2 degrees celsius. Not to mention the “contribution” of emission of the food, the clothes and etc. to the increase of CO2 in our atmosphere. Today, most of us put our hope on the technology along will assist us get rid of the problem. Nevertheless, the truth is “no matter how hard we try, making a 5,000 pound vehicle to carry one person will never be environmentally sound for the planet.” Relying on technology to help us get away from the climate problem is merely wasting our efforts and driving away our attention from the real job at hand. Prof.Ken also gives us the positive and simple ways to address the climate problem—taking buses, subways and train. It is true that mass transportation is more effective than private cars. On the same amount of the emission of CO2, bus can hold 40 people comparing to private cars which can hold no more than 7 people. Reducing the car trips and increasing taking the public transports can absolutely contribute to the reduction of CO2. Even though I live in a place where it is very convenient to take public transportation to reach everywhere, because of the laziness, I was reluctant to take the public transportation since it could not send me to the direct destination and I had to walk for a while to get my real destination. After watching this video, I decide that even though the public transportation will bring a bit of inconvenience, I will insist to take the public transports as many times as possible to make a contribution for out society.

<p>
After listening to Professor Hiltner's I wholeheartedly agree that we need to look deeper at societal norms damaging the environment and address those. Cars for most individuals are deeply involved in our lives for work and social purposes and it poses a very difficult issue to replace our cars with another form of transportation. While public transport is widely talked about for the positive impact compared to cars aren't practical for the world, at least now. Where I was raised was a smaller beach town where public transportation only covers a handful of streets in town. So for my town switching to relying just on public transportation would be impossible without spending millions of dollars on new infrastructure. Additionally, we aren't the only city in the US that doesn't have a lot of public transportation so economically it seems daunting to propose as a solution. Personally, I don't have the permanent solution to breaking the fad of cars and hopefully, we can discover a new form of transportation less damaging. However, public transportation should be made more available in smaller cities than just large populous cities until a solution is made rather than making parking structures and roads. Just like all things related to climate change people want to wait for the storm to pass but don't understand the problem won't pass this is the permanent world we live in. So any effort I feel being made as long as it's positive isn't a waste of time and the right solution, yes there are some that have a greater impact but every step we should be taking needs to be climate-conscious.

After watching Ken’s video, I learned about a lot of ways to reduce my generation’s carbon emissions. My generation can stop driving as much and instead, ride a bike. Or instead of flying on a plane, ride a boat to other countries. This will help with CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Also, instead of trying to live in a big home, be mindful of the environment and instead live in a smaller house. Now that I am informed, I will clean up my diet and eat more veggies which require less water. In addition, one pound of beef is equivalent to 30 lentils. Not many people know about how harmful animal agriculture is on our planet, and I think everyone needs to be informed. Another thing people can do is have only one child. The population needs to stop growing at the rate it currently is because we will run out of our planet’s resources sooner than later. Ken made a good point by mentioning that it costs $9,000 dollars a year to maintain. He also says that the money you use to maintain a car can be used for a retirement fund instead which will solve many other issues. I didn’t know how harmful driving cars were until I watched this video, and I am greatful for the knowledge. 
<br><br>
 Ken suggests that we should drive less cars and I agree, but it’s a bit ironic because the politicians who are for a better environment are the ones who use Uber and fly constantly. A perfect example of this is Alexandria Cortes who is a liberal who supports the Green New Deal. She constantly uses Uber and flys to other states for her work, yet she is the one who is contributing to the problem. We need to stop these people from joining the movement because they will make those who are actually passionate about the movement look bad in the eyes of the public. The only way they can stay is if they change their ways and stop driving cars.
</p><hr>



<p>
It's shocking that the average American has to cut their emissions from 20 metric tons to 2 in order to stay within the limits set by the Paris Accords. That puts an individual responsibility to the issue -- and emphasizes the importance for individuals to give up their cars, or at least switch to electric.
<br><Br>
I agree with Ken that the prospect of a cultural change is exciting -- it shows that we don't have to wait for any technological change to save us from our incredibly high emissions. That technology already exists in the form of subways, trains, and buses -- it's just up to us to use it and incorporate it into our society as a 'cool' means of transportation.
<br><Br>
I think the incorporation of public transportation into suburban communities would be a worthwhile public policy initiative since those in the suburbs are more dependent on cars for transportation than in the city. Investment in buses and train systems is important -- Gavin Newsom's shutdown of California's plan for a high-speed rail system, for example, may have been a shutdown of a major emissions savings plan.

<p>
One thing I couldn’t stop thinking about during this video is all the unintended consequences of our actions in relation to the climate crisis. So much of the pollution we add to the world is done unknowingly and in ways we never even think about. For instance, how the very production of a single car creates more than enough carbon emissions for a single person in a year, even with the creation of electric cars. The ways in which we are striving to combat this ongrowing crisis only seem to lead us to different ways of releasing carbon into the atmosphere or polluting oceans and ecosystems with plastic and garbage. Attempts to switch to reusable straws and bottles may appear to be alleviating the issue usually seem to end up contributing to it in a different way, which makes it hard for people to find alternatives to the more prominent contributors like plastics and carbon emissions.
</p><hr>



<p>
Throughout the lecture video, I couldn’t help but draw so many similarities and comparisons to the first chapter of Thoreau. Before we are even conceived we are set up to enter this world where cultural norms dictate how we operate and what decisions we make in our daily lives. And I was especially intrigued when Ken touched on the topic as to why do we find cars cool? I thought the obvious answer was “freedom”, however, I didn’t realize the historical factors that lead to the investment of billions of dollars in the cultural establishment of making cars cool as an answer to save the United States from economic collapse post-war. It makes me ponder the question as to what would have happened had the United States government poured the same amount of capital into mass transportation while also not promoting the notion of suburbia. Instead of making the system to where affordable housing is greatly further away from where most people work, the United States should have given more federal funding to urban planning and things of that nature so that the norm to be “cool” would be to take mass transportation, if not walk to as many places as possible. This video also made me realize the power of cultural change compared to technological change as it can be equal, if not potentially far greater not just in climate-related risks but also in other facets of life.
</p><hr>



<p>
Ken mentions how in his discussion of cars and their impact on the planet that he might “lose” a lot of us, I can certainly see how this is the case and I will admit that I was not privy to the idea of giving up the freedom of a car. Cars are a staple of American culture and the only way to reduce their effect on the planet is to change that culture.  I find the notion of a city being the best place for our planet really interesting and I think a place like Los Angeles, known for its horrible traffic, could benefit greatly from an expanded public transportation network. I do wonder if cars are the place that climate activists should focus most of their energy on as I see the challenge might be one of the harder one’s to tackle.  If we are just trying to reduce overall emissions I think convincing people to become vegetarian, or buy recycled clothes, or vote against fracking, or live in apartments might be a better place to start. The sheer amount of cultural change that would have to occur to rid the United States of cars might be more trouble than it’s worth at this stage of the fight. Elon Musk is mentioned in this video in a somewhat negative connotation and I think that reduction is what is most important right now and he is playing a part in that. The amount of change that we need to inspire is not going to happen overnight and I think any small steps we can take in the right direction should be praised. Around 20 metric tons of CO2 per person is not going to fall to 2 in a snap but if one can reduce their footprint by doing some more attainable things, like reducing meat consumption to only 5 days a week or buying an electric car, I think it is at the very least an admirable place to start.

<p>
I do believe technological innovations like electric vehicles can help the cause of climate change. However, given how expensive and the inaccessibility of these technology to the general public right now and the amount of carbon budget the world has left, it is hard to say how much these innovations can benefit the society in the near future. We definitely have to change the way we live. According to the lecture video “Why the climate crisis is a cultural problem (and why electric cars are more trouble than good)“, public transportation (buses, subway, and trains) are far more efficient compared to private vehicles which produce a quarter of carbon emissions. While public transportations seem like decent solutions to reducing emissions, I thought some of these means of transportations are only available and efficient in the city (subway for example). Even then most cities do not have subways constructed in the United States. In rural areas, driving cars would still be more convenient unless the government is determined to improve the service of public transportation. It is crucial that more efforts should go into development of public transportations in major cities. There needs to be an incentive for people to utilize public transportation. Posing a carbon tax and spending the revenue collected on improving public transportation services and providing subsidy to electric vehicles could be another option too.

<p>
The argument of cars is probably the first argument I heard when I learned about climate change. Especially living in Los Angeles cars seem to be a necessity even though they cause so much pollution. I agree that we can not make a car that releases zero emissions, but we can change our own beliefs.  This ties with minimalism, we know that it may be very difficult to just not have a car especially for traveling to work and other places, but why do you need 3 cars? My father like many people is obsessed with having cars, we own three cars,  when my dad told me he was getting another car I was always so upset, mostly for financial reasons. I also always wondered why people will have old rusty cars lying around their yard, what purpose does having all these cars serve? I don't think they are of any use, sometimes we just have things because we can. I hope that people change their obsession with cars, because like Ken said there is no way to make a whole car for one person that releases no CO2. What we can change is the way we view what we need vs. what we want.

My neighbors back home have so many cars lying around their house. Their driveway and our street is literally filled with their cars. Most of them do not even touch they are just there wasting space. I also do not understand what is the need for all these cars. In my household there are no extra cars, only the ones needed. Yet there are people who are obsessed with buying cars. Most that they do not need but they see that they are being sold for a `good price” and buy it. They think they are saving money but the purchase of that car is much greater when it is affecting other factors such as the emission that is being produced. I really hope that technological innovations happen soon as it could be too late for the future of our home.

After watching the video I was able to realize how cars are damaging to the environment. I was always aware that cars were not environmentally friendly since they release so much CO2 into the atmosphere. One thing that I never stopped to think about however, was that the manufacturing of cars also is harmful to the environment. I was astonished to learn that the manufacture of one car releases two metric tons of CO2. Additionally, I always believed that electric cars where good for the environment not knowing the ugly truth. Manufacturing these cars releases emissions into the air as well. I am confident that there are many out there that have bought these cars believing they are taking a step in the right direction and being environmentally friendly. However they are not aware that just the manufacture of these cars reach the maximum amount of emissions we can contributed in a year. The right thing to do for the environment is to move towards walking, biking, and public transportation. These are ways that one would truly be contributing to the well being of the environment.
</p><hr>



<p>
In order to help climate change, we must reduce the amount of CO2 per year to 2 metric tons. I always thought that the electric car because I always heard that it was better for the environment and released less CO2 into the atmosphere. The manufacturing of the car alone releases CO2 and greenhouse emissions. The average lifespan of a car has increased to 11 years and most people do not only have one car but have two or three. That alone exceeds the 2 metric tons per year and that does not include food, clothes etc. In only three decades has gone from 1.78million to 172 million which is insane. I can only imagine that with population growth the use of cars will become much more popular and will increase at a faster rate. We must eliminate the use of cars and start to use busses, bikes, trains. We are becoming lazy our laziness will have a bad outcome

I was sucked into the electric car trend myself. The advertisements had me completely onboard for a car that was sleek, smooth and quiet as well environmentally conscious. You could still have the freedom of a car but feel empowered about contributing to the fight against climate change. I thought our problems were on the verge of being solved and it naively put me at ease. This video was eye-opening! I had no idea how much carbon is emitted just in the manufacturing process. Ken mentioned that if we were to limit temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius, like agreed on in the Paris Accord, each person could only emit 2 metric tons of Carbon Dioxide per year. To buy a car and not even use it already exceeds that carbon footprint. It was fascinating to realize we should not be focusing on new technological innovations but rather changing our cultural practices. 
<br><br>
 Ken mentions the risks and financial burdens involved in driving vehicles and the fact that advertising has pushed us to ignore these factors. Not only will switching to public or other modes of transportation greatly reduce our individual carbon footprint, but we will avoid potential accidents and save money. It was an interesting new perspective that he introduced in the video. Cars have never made much sense, but car companies are what receive federal funding and what the government has made sure are necessary to get around in some places. On top of this, advertising since WWII makes cars appear beautiful and crucial. If we let go of the feeling that we are obligated to get a car, we can open ourselves up to other ways to get around.

Wow. This was, by far, my favorite lecture video of Ken's that I have watched. Being from LA, I have a deep relationship with the car. My dad works from home some of the time, but most of the time he has to commute several hours to work (depending on traffic) and several hours back every day (he does drive an electric car, but after this video I know that his electric car is not as helpful as I thought but still more helpful than a gasoline car). Unsurprisingly, he HATES cars and driving. Only one year younger than Ken, he grew up when cars were the coolest. He got his drivers license on his 16th birthday and thought that cars were the epitome of freedom. Now, cars and driving are his greatest burden. He often has to work 16 hour days--much of that time is spent commuting. He is always stressed when driving (and my dad is never stressed, ever) and is exhausted after stepping out of a car. He has bad joints, which only hurt more after sitting in a car for hours. I could go on forever about all the reasons he hates driving, but just know it is one of his least favorite things in the whole world. Because of this ( and my mom's equal hatred of driving), I don't have a drivers license. (Don't think that my family is some eco-friendly miracle though, my family still owns 3 cars). Living in Santa Barbara, this isn't a problem. I have a bike which I use to get around campus, IV, and certain parts of Goleta. If I want to go downtown, I take the 24x which goes directly from the bus loop to downtown SB. It takes the same amount of time to drive there and buses run frequently enough that it is equally convenient. I also enjoy riding the bus more than riding in a car. I'm able to read and do homework in the bus without getting car sick. I don't have to worry about parking, and I can bring anybody with me without fear that there's too many people to fit in a car. 
<br><br>
Despite this, the fact that cars are "cool" still affected me. I was always embarrassed to not have a drivers license and I fully intended to get one. I knew that cars were bad for the environment, but I thought that driving an electric car would solve this problem, so I'd still be able to drive. I didn't realize until this video that eve electric cars are environmentally destructive. Now, I don't want to drive. I hate driving (I have a permit) and cars are too ridiculously expensive to own. Seeing that I plan to live in big cities for the rest of my life, I don't need a car. Now, I will proudly flaunt my inability to drive and will remember that mass transit really is cooler than cars.

I saw another comment on here that questioned the feasibility of moving toward a future without as much cars. At the beginning of this video I held the same belief as well. How could I ask others to part from their cars when I would like to own a car in the future? The idea of giving up on that goal seemed out of the question; even to me cars seem cool. But as Ken continued to explain and give information about the situation I surprised myself with how quickly my feelings shifted. The facts like that manufacturing cars contributes greatly to CO2 emissions and that you work one day out of the week to pay for your car changed my perspective greatly. After watching this video, I feel similarly. There is still a good part of me that would like a car, but now that I know much more about the topic, I feel like in the future this decision would not be made lightly.

Ken makes the important point that technological innovations might be helpful, but cultural changes are often needed too. It is far easier for us to rely on technology than it is for us to change our lifestyle choices. When it comes to cars, electric vehicles are a way that people can trick themselves into thinking they are helping the environment. People simply rely on the development of electric cars as a patch for the terrible impact that driving has on our environment. People do not actually look into the whole picture of the way their car affects the environment, but rather just at the zero emissions from the tailpipe. People are intentionally blind to the negative impacts of their choices because it makes their lives easier. Switching to public transport is a difficult challenge, so people are not willing to do it. Rather they search for a way that science and technology can minimize their carbon footprint so that they don't have to do so with their own actions. Changing the way you live is incredibly difficult and it is far easier to justify your lifestyle by saying you are making a change to be more green, even if you are aware that what you are doing still has a huge carbon footprint. Because of this, people need to be more aware of the full environmental effects of their transportation decisions. We need to be more vocal about the need for lifestyle changes in how we commute and the potential downsides to electric cars.

Before this class, I had thought that the only way to help the issue of climate change would be that through electric cars, wind turbines and solar panels. I thought that if technological advances were what got us into this mess then it could get us out of it. I was very surprised to hear the impact that Americans have on other countries and how we made cars look cool and more and more were being manufactured. When thinking about this, I thought if we had such a big impact on the way other countries consume, then imagine the impact we could have on other countries if we advocated more about climate change. This then made me angry that Trump decided to withdraw from the Paris Agreement because the US should use its influence to do good and influence other countries to better our planet. In Ken's video, he also mentions that we need to focus our attention on reengineering the cultural practice of car use. Because oftentimes people want the best cars to look cool or wealthy but they don’t realize the impact their vehicle has on climate change.

<p>
It is frustrating that society is saying that it is each individual’s responsibility to reduce their carbon emissions while not addressing how large corporations are the biggest polluters and not holding them accountable for their actions. While technological advancements sound cool in theory, we are once again marketing zero-emission cars to consumers and saying it will reduce their carbon footprints, while not addressing the amount of carbon emissions that are produced from manufacturing these cars. It was also shocking for me to realize that currently, each person is emitting ten times the amount of carbon emissions than we should be to keep the earth from heating over 1.5 degrees Celsius, and we are still doing little to nothing about it on a societal scale. This means that we have to make huge changes to our lifestyles; public transportation, for one, would be the most ideal transition to make. Public transportation is the solution to fixing the damage that cars and car manufacturing has had on the environment. The choice is clear between cars and public transportation - while the average car usually carries one person and can transport that person 25 miles per one gallon, public transportation can transport someone up to 750 miles for one gallon. The issue with public transportation in America is how faulty, unreliable, and out of date it can be, especially in places like L.A. For a city of its size, it is shocking that it doesn’t have an adequate and efficient bus or subway system; the ones in place are in need of improvement and many people would prefer to drive rather than use public transportation, which is part of the problem. The lack of decent public transportation is even worse in suburban and rural areas, where it is sometimes necessary to have a car to even buy groceries. In contrast, Japan is an example of how useful and convenient public transportation can be; when I visited Osaka and Kyoto, I did all of my traveling through their extensive railway system. From my perspective, it was even more convenient to use than just driving myself around. Although it will be hard to change our cultural standpoint on car usage, especially given its deep-rooted grasp ever since the post-WWII era, it is something that must be done for the betterment of our society.

Before I came to the U.S four years ago, some told me that I would not be able to go anywhere without a car. And after these years, I have to say they are definitely correct. Except living in big cities like New York, which has a much more complete public transportation system than most of the cities in the U.S., most of time, people do need a car for a living, especially in California. 
<br><br>
I am very surprised that the production of electric cars produce more emissions than regular cars. This information really broadened my horizon because the only emission I thought coming from the car is the emission of driving. Ken also mentioned about the significant growth of automobiles in China in the past three decades. As I was growing right within this timeline, this is correct and incredible. When I was in elementary school, each family of my mates at most have one car, even some of them did not own one. On the other hand, by the time of my high school years, families in my city approximately have at least two cars. Admittedly, even though this change indicates the improvements of Chinese people living standards, this is really such a crisis to the earth; what’s more, people seems not taking care about the climate changes that much when they choose to buy what they want even today in China. Good news is that the government started to encourage people to buy electric cars to protect the environment five years ago, and their goal is to transfer 70% of the owners of regular car to those of electric cars by 2025. Don’t know if this is accessible, but at least it’s a good sign.

I really do not think that these technological advances are allowing us to live our lives without changing them. In a sense, they are, but also in the grand scheme of things I think it is a step in the right direction. I feel as if recently, climate change has become a more widely discussed topic in society and people are more socially aware. However, since it is just beginning, this does not mean that everyone is aware of what is happening or know that they need to start making changes to their life. I agree that many things should be cut out of our lives completely, such as cars, but for those who do not really understand, it is harder to get them adapted to this lifestyle. Many people want to live a life of comfort and I believe that asking them to cold turkey is not the answer. What people need is to be slowly acclimated to this new time. Making technological advances makes little changes in the impact of the environment, but it makes big steps in terms of making people more aware of what they are using. The big impact is that more people are learning why they think electric cars are better to use (in the example of electric cars). When more “environmentally friendly” items become more mainstream, people gather more knowledge and do more research and start to get a sense of what the environmental ramifications are. They will start to make bigger changes, such as cutting a car out completely. Due to this, I would have to disagree with Ken’s statement that it was a waste to spend time thinking of how to create an electric car with no emissions when we should have thought of ways to cut cars out completely. Introducing items such as electric cars just helps influence those who have no knowledge about the environment change into someone who is more conscious about what they are using and doing.

After watching this video, I was shocked to learn how much of an impact automobiles make on our climate crisis. I found it crazy that cars release 2 metric tons of CO2 per year, and that just if we leave them parked in our driveways. We are only supposed to release 2 metric tons per year as humans and having a car already exceeds our limit. Not to mention driving the vehicle releases more CO2 into the atmosphere every time. Additionally, we release CO2 into the atmosphere doing everyday routines without even knowing it. We need to be more aware of our surroundings and how much CO2 we are releasing we when we do certain things like drive and instead try to find healthier alternatives. As you mentioned, it would be beneficial for our society to start relying on other modes of transportation to reduce CO2 emissions. It would be very difficult to get people to start riding public transportation because they most likely prefer the comfort and privacy of their own vehicle. If we really wanted people in society to drive less and reduce the CO2 emissions we would need to improve the quality and enjoyment of our public transportation. We need to make buses, subways, and trains more tolerable and enjoyable to ride so that we can change our mode of transportation. I also found it surprising that electric cars are not as environmentally friendly as they were once promoted. We need to find ways to decrease CO2 emissions from cars in the future so that we can fix our climate crisis.

Hi. I was also shocked to learn how much carbon dioxide is released in the air per year from one car. I use my car for everything, but after watching this video, I decided to be more efficient in using it. I can simply bike to get groceries or walk to my friends house or even run to the gym. I agree with how we need to improve our modes of transportation in America like more buses and trains. I thought of switching to an electric car, but I did not know how  detrimental they were to the environment. Technology alone is not enough to solve this difficulty, but changing our ways of living could help with it. Although this is still a reoccurring problem, we need to fix this issue and find ways to decrease our carbon dioxide emissions.

I think you bring up some great points and highlight some of the most impactful stuff from Ken’s lecture video. I do think though that probably the best way to reduce CO2 emissions during transportation isn’t something to be found as you mentioned at the end of your comment, but lies in the restructuring of car culture in America as Ken mentioned. 
  <br><br>
  For example, I consider myself pretty environmentally aware and passionate about solving the climate crisis and doing my part. But man, did this video expose me… I love my car. I have spent hours customizing it and hand-installing those customizations, have spent probably thousands of dollars on it, and love to take it whenever me and my friends drive somewhere. I should probably add that I have a 2013 Jeep Wrangler… and I get about 14.3 miles per gallon with it... this all goes to show that even though this car is not economically efficient in terms of spending money on gas, nor is it good for the environment, that I love it anyways. I am definitely a sucker for the car culture that has developed in America and I am not proud to admit it. 
    <br><br>
     Cars just from their production, like you said, already max out the 2 metric tons of CO2 emissions goal per year per person, even if they are just sitting in the driveway. This shows that there really isn’t a solution in technology, but in the same way as many other environmental issues, a solution in the restructuring of cultural norms. This is no easy task, especially for people who are so deeply rooted in some of them as I am, but it IS one we need to face if we want to survive.

Ken's perspective on humanities playing a bigger role in fazing out car transportation was very interesting to hear as I hadn't ever really considered it before.  It was also crazy to learn how much co2 gets released simply making a single car, especially when you look to how many cars are produced per day, and how many there already are driving on the roads.  I also never realized that it was almost $9,000 annually to pay for a car, that is an insane amount of money that you could instead be putting towards savings, whether that be retirement or for traveling costs.  However, I don't think it is possible for a lot of the population to give up their cars.  I come from a pretty small coastal town on the central coast of CA, and without a car, it is pretty much impossible to get from place to place.  There is no public transport, and most houses are very spread out and far away from the downtown, it wouldn't be possible to simply walk to work, especially since most people live in the next town over, which is separated by a lot of miles and would be a long way to trek every time you needed to grocery shop, or pick up your child from school, or go surfing.  However, I do agree that society has an unhealthy obsession with the image and appeal of a new car, and I hate that people view and judge statuses based on the type of car you own/how new it is.  I think that electric cars are a very good step in the right direction, however, I think it will take a long time to transition most of the population into those types of cars because so many people buy cars used.  At my high school, most people's first cars are older and used cars, no one has the money to buy a new car and neither do their parents.  I think out of my entire high school only a select like 10 kids had a car that was only 3 years old or newer (and their parents bought it for them).   I wish that I could get rid of my car, as living in IV it is very easy to get around with a bike, and I never use my car around IV and Goleta as I just bike everywhere.  However, I visit home almost every weekend to see my boyfriend, or drive south to Ventura or north to jalama to find waves to surf (because Santa barbara is very protected from waves because of the channel islands).  Eventually, I hope that the societal stigma surrounding cars can change, and I think that change will start with my generation.

Going into this video, and having read the title, I figured Ken was going to talk about how electric cars are better for the planet but that their lithium batteries create problems as far as disposal goes. However, he barely touched on this and instead discussed the production of electric cars and its CO2 emissions. I had no idea the toll of manufacturing an electric car was so bad and so much worse than a gasoline car. That being said, I still think moving toward electric cars will be beneficial as far as the climate crisis goes, because it will get people into the right mind set. It may sound dumb, but when people think of electric cars, they think about renewable resources and how desperately our planet needs us to cooperate right now. Any time I see an electric car, I am reminded of climate change. As Ken mentioned, electric cars, in the long run, end up emitting far less CO2 than gasoline cars, despite the higher levels of emissions during production. 
<br><br>
I absolutely agree with Ken that we must turn to public transportation as a solution, however, it is going to take many Americans a long time to make the switch. A switch that I believe can happen more quickly is that of switching from gasoline to electric cars. Public transportation should absolutely be the end goal, but in the meantime, we must have a temporary solution. As we’ve seen in previous lectures, there is always a delay between findings and action. And even though I know this is a desperate and urgent issue that needs mending now, switching to electric cars is a start. That being said, I completely agree that public transportation needs to become more normal. It shouldn’t be seen as something used by and for “poor people” but rather something that is used by people who want to see the end of the climate crisis. In many major cities, it is becoming more and more widely used (New York, Paris, London), but that won’t cut it. We need public transportation to become more accessible everywhere, if we want to see change happen.

<p>
This lecture was particularly interesting to me.  I think, like Ken said, the general public is either unaware of the affect automobiles have on our climate, don’t care, or are hoping for an affordable version of an electric or zero emissions car.  It is a very different perspective to instead look at the problem at hand and actually address it, rather than wait for someone else to make the change for you.  For example, many people hope that scientists will find a new way to let us keep up the lifestyle we have, but if one were to be realistic about it, they would realize this is a pipe-dream.  As much as there are scientists that care about the environment, there are just as many people in power who benefit off of the wealth fossil fuels produce.  When the people who have the most influence in our society choose to be selfish, it impacts in ripples through the entire world.  Like Ken said, America does usually create trends that are considered “cool” and carry throughout nations.  We need to be the change that the people in power cannot be.  But how do we do that?  Like said in the lecture, it is not enough to just wait around and hope to keep the life you already live.  With some sacrifices, we do not have to wait for a better alternative, like taking buses to work or trains to places we want to go instead of paying to harm our environment.
<br><br>
 The tough part of this is not just changing the culture, but the actual inconvenience it brings.  I think in order for this to work, we would have to subsidize companies to focus on buses and subways, to make them cleaner with enough buses to keep the travel time for each traveler at a minimum.  It is never fun to take an hour to work by bus because of the stops when you could just make a 15 minute drive in a car.  This convenience, though, should be advertised as a replacement for the inconvenient price of a car (including insurance).  Like Ken said, being able to retire in your forties would be a huge treat that would be a big incentive for those unsure of choosing to stop using a car.

<p>
This video was definitely eye opening. I had no idea that manufacturing cars were releasing that much carbon into the atmosphere. Everyone seems to think that electric cars are the solution to all of our problems, but Ken has made us rethink that. I do believe that cars are very much so a part of the world, and I can hardly see everyone deciding to give up their cars at once to take the bus, so on that front, electric cars do seem like the better option. People love their cars; more than anything else, in my opinion. Regardless of the type of car, there's something about the freedom and comfort it provides to be able to drive anywhere at any time. Buses are great, don't get me wrong. My mom is probably the biggest public transportation advocate I know, but not for environmental reasons, she's just opposed to paying for parking. So because of this, I grew up on the bus. Starting in middle school I would take it with my friends, or alone, to get where I needed to go. It's not like my dad wouldn't offer to drive me somewhere, it was that I preferred the freedom of it. That being said, the minute I turned 16 I was licensed and driving. Even more freedom. Buses are great, but once you have the freedom of driving a car directly to your destination without having to stop a ton of times, it's hard to go back. My mom rides the bus home from work everyday, and she appreciates not having to drive so that she can read. And I understand where she's coming from; it is nice to not have the responsibility of driving sometimes. 

<br><br>
What was said about 1/3 of the people in Manhattan walking to work is amazing. I personally love big cities and subway systems because I love walking. And subways are far superior to buses in my opinion, so I'm clearly a big NYC fan. Unfortunately, as Ken pointed out, a lot of people live in the suburbs, and that lifestyle more or less requires a car. I was recently visiting some family in Phoenix, and they live deep in the suburbs. I noticed as we were driving around that not only did I see a single bus, but I didn't see a single person walking down the street. Suburbs breed people to drive from one end of the parking lot to the other. It's a very private life. It's like convenience on steroids. I'm personally not a fan of that way of life, but for those people, moving to a city could be difficult. And we can't all live in cities. New York, for example, probably has the best public transportation system in the country and is most walkable, yet it is also extremely expensive to live there. There's clearly not going to be an easy answer to this problem, there's too many factors, and we're so deep into it that we're scrambling to try to find our quickest out, but it just doesn't work like that.

With the development of science and technology, cars are more and more popular. From the United States to the world, more and more people start to use cars to travel. And in the eyes of Americans, car travel is a cool thing, which is like a kind of cultural transmission. Thus, people can not easily give up this way of travel. However, we should understand that the exhaust emissions of cars will bring environmental pollution, so it takes more money to maintain a car, and also needs to bear the risk of traffic accidents. Therefore, we should understand that the disadvantages of car travel always outweigh the advantages. Of course, we cannot deny the convenience brought by scientific and technological innovation. Instead, we ought to try to use technological innovation to alleviate the climate crisis. We should advocate reducing car travel and replacing it with walking, cycling and taking buses, so as to reduce carbon emissions and alleviate the current climate crisis.

Before I had a car, and I had to go from San Diego to LA and back, I would take the Amtrak. I have a car but not to show social status. I drive for the convenience of it. Ken said that public transportation is the more convenient option, to which many might agree, but there are many ways that it isn’t—I can say that from personal experience. On the train, you have to make multiple stops and the trip can take hours longer than it would by car. Driving is also better economically for me. I would definitely take public transportation more often if it were cheaper. A train ticket for a trip between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles costs at least $30 and takes almost an hour more than driving. Because I drive a Hyundai Elantra and I get about 38 miles per gallon of gas, a trip to LA only costs me about $10 for gas. That’s a whole lot cheaper; being a student who is just getting the hang of living on my own, I make the majority of my decisions with my financial situation in mind. Of course I’m concerned about the environmental impacts of driving cars and reducing my carbon footprint, but I simply can’t afford to make my trips home via public transportation. I wish it weren’t this way, but unless the price of train tickets is suddenly cut in half, I don’t see how it will be possible for me to make the switch any time soon.

In high school I drove 40 minutes each way to go to and from to school.  If I include other drives I made, I probably averaged 100 minutes of car driving every day for 2 and a half years.  Back then I could not imagine living without a car.  Now that I am in college without my car, my CO2 footprint has reduced dramatically.  I only bike on a daily basis and I am only in a car a few times per month.  Now that I do bike I see this as a much more viable option of transportation. 

<br><br>
 I agree that most of climate change is a cultural issue, not one with scientific or technological answers.  I had a culture shift from a life completely  reliant on driving, to one with very little.  Yet I disagree with the idea that we just buy cars because they are cool.  If you have 2-3 cars then car #2 and car #3 are cool, but car #1 is bought for utility.  For my same drive to school, if I were to take the bus it would take me 3 hours, and train 2.5 hours.  When I have to be at school by 8, that time table is virtually impossible.  There is and always will be a need for cars, yet we need to shift our focus from them being a luxury item, to them being a utilitarian item.  This is where we could add a tax on any additional cars purchased, but it is unlikely that any law like that would even be considered in a bi-partisan way.

I still remember back to a few weeks ago, one question was asking what suggestions do you have or what we can do to help in the global warming issue, I confidently put drive an electric car. After I finish this video, I realize how naive I am. It is a common misunderstanding that driving an electric car do not use fuel so it is the final answer for us. However, we do not think about the cost of producing it. After Ken mention two numbers 5000 pounds and 150 pounds, I was shocked. We all know car is heavy but when he gives you 2 sharp contrast number, it is scary. We are using 5000 pounds to carry 150 pounds everyday and everywhere, it is obviously that it does not sound environmental beneficial. I also strongly agree with the idea that it is not science work but the social science work. We know buses and public transportation are the real answer, but they just do not look cool like cars. So we know the answer and we are not choosing them because they are not cool. How can we really change that situation? In fact, U.S is the country that has very poor public transportation compare to China, Singapore or U.K. More people in the rest of the world uses more public transportation than U.S. Just like Ken said, thinking about you working one day per week for your car which could be solved easily by public transportation. Compare the freedom in have in your car every morning than the money you can saved and retire 20 years earlier than others. What is the real wise choice?

<p>
All throughout your teenage years people always ask you when you’ll get your driver’s license, as if it is some great rite of passage that grants you the freedom to go wherever you want. I remember when my friends were getting their first cars and buying parking permits for our high school parking lot, just as so many other students across the country were doing as well. This all seemed so normal and inconsequential at the time, but now that I have begun to learn more about the climate crisis and how our actions always come with a cost, this ‘normal’ event is pretty worrisome. In America cars are extremely romanticized when in reality they are a major source of pollution and injury every single day. Cars are seen as something so essential in our lives and there is not a single point in my life when my family did not own at least one car, as of right now we even own two. I come from a fairly rural area so almost everyday both of my parents drive to work and I have never stopped twice to think about just how destructive this seemingly normal practice is.

<br><br>
One thing I am proud of is how my dad started a program at his work that encourages biking to work and even created a monthly challenge using an app that rewards the person who bikes the most frequently. This was widely accepted at his job because he does happen to work for an environmental affairs department with pretty environmentally conscious coworkers, but I hope that if more people suggested this in their own workplaces that it could gain momentum elsewhere. While in this particular case biking was encouraged other workplaces could also encourage taking public transport instead of driving because this is also a more environmentally conscious choice. Not everyone has the ability to bike but more people have access to the bus or the subway. 

<br><br>

When people think of the carbon footprint of city living versus living in the suburbs they might think that the city would be a worse option. Cities always seem to be bustling with life which would suggest a great amount of power usage, which could fuel this assumption that city living is less environmentally conscious. I was definitely under this assumption for at least part of my because I failed to consider just how impactful commuting by car is. When Professor Hiltner said that just owning a car, not even driving it, is already enough to max out our ideal carbon emissions for a year I was really surprised and disheartened. While it is possible for most people in the city to walk or use public transport it is pretty unlikely that people in rural areas will ever be able to completely rely on those alternatives, which is why this issue is so concerning. While I would love to have everyone in my hometown cut down on their emissions by driving less I cannot reasonably stop them from driving when the nearest doctors with quality practices are an hour away by car. In the case of rural areas it is much less about the “coolness” of owning a car but more about the necessity of having transportation to larger cities with resources that they do not have readily available.

<br><br>

Limiting car usage is something that I truly need to work on. While I do not personally own a car I am guilty of having my parents drive for several hours to pick me up for breaks in their car rather than taking the train. While they would still have to drive an hour to pick me up at the nearest train station, this would already limit my emissions a great deal because as Professor Hiltner mentioned, a train is 30 times more efficient than a car. Something that has also helped me limit my car usage is the free bus pass that is provided for students. Rather than asking my friend to drive me somewhere in their car I can instead, at least most of the time, take the bus, which is 14 times more efficient.

<p>
I totally agree that in the United States we could put more federal money into improving mass transportations like buses and trains. Since coming to UCSB I have noticed that many people bike to get around as well as taking the bus if they want to go somewhere far, and many students use the train as a way of traveling back home to visit family. Something I have noticed about the United States’ national train system, Amtrak, is that it’s completely unreliable and costly. I feel like that is why more students turn to carpool and rideshare as a way to visit our hometowns. Don’t get me wrong carpooling is better than everybody individually driving, but as Hiltner has mentioned in the video above, if we can just shift our society into thinking that mass transportation is cooler than driving a car than we can significantly lower our carbon footprint as a whole country. A big thing that we then need to change is we have to improve the cost and time efficiency of our mass transportations. One big reason why I chose to rideshare than take the train back home is that it takes way more time and money so, in the end, it is not worth it. As a country, we need to put this as a priority towards combatting the climate crisis, and I believe we can get lots of people on board with switching to using mass transportation over cars. We are one of the only developed nations that do not have reliable mass transportation for its citizens. Another thing is since our mass transit is not reliable it just makes it that much harder for people who can’t afford a car to use it as a viable option.

I learned a lot in this video lecture regarding how exactly cars emit CO2. Before watching this, I always thought driving the car was the main way that a car pollutes, but I never knew that the manufacturing process contributed so much. I used to want a Tesla , but now I am reconsidering it. I would like to know if it’s more efficient to keep my car longer (keep using gas) or switch to an electric car? (Knowing that not driving at all is the best option) This also prompts me to think about all the items that we purchase but don’t think is contributing to climate change (examples: clothes, snacks, beauty products). Every purchase we make adds to our carbon footprint, and in an age where it is so convenient to buy things (Amazon, online shopping), we naturally buy more things they we don’t need just for the sake of buying them. 
<br><br>
Considering the principles of minimalism brought up in Thoreau’s Walden, personally, I don’t think the hardest part about helping the climate is getting people to go Vegan or take public transport. I think the hardest part is getting people to give up all the things that they wish to buy. We all know that hoarding is a problem, but many of us subconsciously believe that “more is better”. Speaking from my own experience, I often find myself buying things that I don’t really need, like too many pairs of pajama pants.
</p><hr>



<p>
I was aware that the U.S. had great influence over other countries but I didn't realize how strong it was. Another thing I learned from this video is that the car industry flourished to keep the U.S. economy booming after World War 11. How incredibly selfish was it of us to deem car cools just for the benefit of our own economy. We convinced the rest of the world essentially to condemn our civilization to death. Furthermore, I find it very hypocritical of the U.S. who got to experience all these luxury goods to tell other nations that they can't do the same because they will kill us all. 
<br><br>
American culture was built on the idea that bigger is better as well as the more the better. The fact that owning a car is so expensive and dangerous does not deter the average American from buying one. We Americans are constantly seeking to live in bigger houses and own more things. If someone as big as the U.S. would start (as hypocritical as this sounds) to phase out cars maybe we would stand a chance as we have seen the incredible influence they have. However, we also have to understand that for poor and middle class people sometimes a car is the only way they can get to places. My mom cannot get to work on time on the bus system and it would just make it a living hell for her to go and come back. Yet these huge corporations get to release all these greenhouse gasses while my mom is the one being attacked and shamed. The solution to all of this is that we need to invest in our public transportation system. More frequent stops and wider distances traveled would make it easier for people like my mom to switch over to it.

This was definitely my favorite video from this class. I'm a, er, this sounds weird, but a NUMTOT-- aka, a member of the Facebook group New Urbanist Memes for Transit-Oriented Teens. It is, yes, a meme group, but it's a strange little niche corner of the internet where policy-wonk dorks like myself huddle around a facebook group and talk about how great public transit is. It's a weird breath of fresh air: it acknowledges how vastly important public transit and urban planning really is, understanding that cars really are a vastly powerful enemy that is so overwhelming not only because of ease but also because our entire country has been built around them. Above all, it's a group about what Ken talks about here: that this is not a problem of technology, but one of humanities. 
<br><br>
Our cities are built for cars. This is an undeniable fact. In the vast majority of America, you essentially cannot get anywhere-- anywhere at all-- without a car or someone else to drive you. Bus systems, train systems, and everything like it are almost nonexistent for anywhere rural, and even in most cities they are tremendously lacking. Out of everyone I know, only college students and those from truly urbanized cities are able to survive at all without a car. This has to change, and it's not a problem of technology. Hyperloop nor Tesla will save us. Only real urban planning, and collective effort, will.

Watching Ken’s lecture video about electric cars, honestly didn’t really change how I felt about them, because overall, I really didn’t care for them anyways, but I did find it interesting that electric cars would still emit even more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, so maybe they aren’t the best alternative. I do agree public transportation is the best option to reduce the amount of CO2 that goes into the atmosphere, but at the same time sometimes public transportation isn’t available for everyone, I know in some kids that went to my school couldn’t take the school because it didn’t go out to them, and the nearest regular bus stop was too far for them so they didn’t have a choice but to walk. A lot of the times people have cars not to be cool but just because it’s more convenient for them, I know personally if my mom didn’t work in a different city she would take the bus, it’s not that the bus is uncool it’s just sometimes it not as convenient as having a car and that’s something you can’t help, especially if your job or school is far out.

I think we have to change some of the lifestyles we are so used to have, combining with the way of how people see about having cars as transportations or a way of living a luxurious life. When I heard that there are more cars in the United States than the people who have a driver’s license I was not as shocked as to how I felt when I saw the title saying that the electric cars are more trouble than good. What I have never thought about driving electric cars is that the production of it could produce that much carbon dioxide that if a person changes his/her cars regularly they do not even have to drive, the carbon footprint would reach the what a person is supposed to have in their lifetimes. There are even more and more people decided to get a driver’s license when they reach the legal age. What I feel like we could or even we should do is that there need to be someone who spread the idea of using public transportation when it is possible, and even if there is no way to take public transportation to go somewhere, for the shorter distance, biking is a good choice, for longer distance, carpooling still could be a better choice than just one person on a car. There are a lot of benefits people could get from the change of lifestyles than just for the environment. I believe there are tons of people who are suffering from driving to work and driving back home in places like Los Angelas. This could solve the problem of traffic as well. I know it sounds a little off-topic, but just to benefit people’s lives in general, using public transportation would be better.

I agree with your assessment Xinyang. The idea that the production of the cars emitting insanely high amounts of CO2 never occurred to me. The insane amounts of emissions from production can easily cancel out the CO2 that is prevented from emissions. America needs to stop buying more and more cars and focus on taking public transport. Many city dwellers are used to never having a car because everything is so close and subways and buses are sufficient. However urban areas where places are further spread out are substantially more difficult to get around. waiting for a bus or biking simply isn't an option. I don't see any possible way of getting out of this issue unless we make everything a city. However I do believe that we should walk and bike when we can. trains can take people 750 miles a gallon which would drastically lower our carbon footprints. I think that if everyone focuses on this task we can minimize the damage we've already done. The longer we wait on this goal the further we will dive this planet into being uninhabitable.

After watching Ken’s lecture video I was surprised to find out that electric cars are worse for the environment than they are good. Nowadays everyone talks about electric cars and how they are the future for the environment. Everyone you talk to will agree that electric cars are good for the environment including me, that is why I was so surprised to find out that they are actually not. Although Electric cars are better than gasoline cars it still emits CO2 into the environment. Ken mentions that electric cars have just been made affordable for most Americans, but not for the rest of the world. The car market has increased rapidly throughout the world and mostly every country wants and needs cars. The problem is that in these other countries outside of the United States and Europe they don’t have electric cars. This doesn’t help reduce emissions of CO2 and ultimately we will still lose the fight to climate change. The solution to this is to make busses cool because they are much more efficient in emitting CO2.

This lesson reminds me of an episode of the tv show "Adam Ruins Everything". And while I agree that buying an electric car for the sake of buying an electric car is bad if you need a new car then an electric car would be the best option. Furthermore, we live in a country where freedom of movement is extremely important and having a car is the only way to have the mobility required to get from point a to point b. Our public transportation simply can't meet the needs of the people of the United States if we want to move away from cars we must change the way we organize cities and the surrounding suburbs.

I personally like to bike everywhere. and I would be interested in hearing how you guys want to get around to reduce your carbon footprint.

As a COMM major the cultural change is the most interesting to me. Especially because all major shifts in history are rooted in cultural change. Usually inventions follow cultural change and not the other way around. Like how the Renaissance  initiated critical thinking and personal growth rather then 'momento mori' it became 'carpe diem'. Via this stance it is absolutely required for us to focus on cultural change rather than inventions. Why is this? Fact is that wanting to do something and actually doing it are way apart. They are actually determined by a number of factors one of which is the Social Norm, What do you perceive to be acceptable. If we can make a shift form cars to public transport as the social norm it is much more likely for people to actually starts using it. Another important thing is the Perceived Social Norm, what do you perceive other people think is important and acceptable.  This is largely reinforced by people we look up to, often in this category are people with a public function (i.e. celebrities etc.). This is why it is exremely important to change the way public figures act and adres the climate change and consumer culture. Change can be brought forth by our generation but starting at the top would make a bigger immediate impact. Changing the system form within is more effective than opposing it.

Specifically this lecture by Ken is one with which I have agreed with the most. I really do think that cars are not such a necessary part of everyday life and that they definitely do take a huge toll on the environment. Although this is my opinion now, it was completely different about six months ago. I really do think that people's opinion on this matters to do a lot with where they live. For me, living in Isla Vista has really impacted my view on cars. Here in IV, and Santa Barbara in general, I either walk, bike, or take the bus everywhere. Although this was only because I was unable to have my car here at first, now I see that a car is not necessary at all and would quite frankly only take money away from me that I would very much enjoy spending on something else. However, when I was still living at home I certainly believed that the only way to get around was with a car, specially considering how big of a city San Diego is. Another thing that made me think this, in my opinion, is that in San Diego public transportation is not as big and as common to ride, like it is here. Therefore, I believe that where someone lives really impacts their use of public transportation. For me personally, living in Santa Barbara has really impacted my views of public transport and the impact that cars have on the environment.
<br><br>
Something that I found really interesting from this lecture, was the fact that 'zero-emission' cars and hybrids still take such an incredible toll on the environment. For me this information was completely new and if I'm completely honest it made me feel very naive and even a little bit taken advantage. Although I don't drive either of these two types of cars, I feel like it is unethical of the companies to call their cars 'zero-emission' when in reality they are not.

After I finished watching the lecture given by Professor, I was astonished by the data the professor presents in this lecture that “a manufactured car is already equivalent to releasing two metric tons of CO2.” This is insane because I never thought buying a car will contribute this much for a person’s carbon footprint. I start to wonder that whether I would purchase a car or not. However, it’s really luring me since having a car will greatly makes me convenient and makes my life easier. Thankfully, there is a alternative choice I can make, which is purchasing the electricity car. The problem with gaining the public opinion is that car culture has become one of the defining characteristics of America. Moreover, right now in China, I can clearly observe that the number of cars is increasing at an astonishing rate. This may be a symbol of development in technology and economics, but also it is terrible for our Earth. The only thing that can solve this problem currently is to take public transportation to reduce carbon emission.

In order for humans to avert the diverse effects of climate, they should change their way of living rather than depending on technological alterations or innovations. Individuals believe that electric cars are the solutions to our crisis, but in the long run, their manufacture and continued usage creates unbearable climatic conditions due to the carbon footprint produced by the vehicles and other utilities an individual uses in their lifetime. The best way to completely solve the climate crisis involves a complete overhaul on the cultural believes and practices engraved in our American lifestyle, which chooses a luxurious life over the associated consequences. Electric vehicles are not the answer and certainly not a solution, but public means of transport are a sure way of minimizing the climatic crisis. The utilization of a single car to carry a single individual is less economical and may cause more damage than good in the name of “freedom” or “luxury” because, in the end, freedom and luxury will be irrelevant if we do not have a conducive environment. Individuals should not only try to reduce the carbon emissions produced by vehicles, but all the activities carried out in a year. By understanding one’s  entire carbon footprint, individuals can change their practices concerning transportation, water usage, electricity utilization, food, clothes and all the other amenities believed to be essential for a satisfactory lifestyle

While I understand Ken’s point about how costly cars are on our environment, I am shocked to see he feels it's even remotely possible for cars to be phased out in America. America is a big place and outside of major cities like New York and San Francisco subway systems are few and far between. It is not feasible for many people to commute to work, school, and other destinations without cars. It is just not something that can be changed easily. Carpooling is one major way to help decrease the number of cars on the road, but there is no way we will eliminate all cars on the road. 
<br><br>
Places like England where there is a sophisticated subway and train system means cars are not necessary if you live in the city. But in America many places (even urban) do not have adequate public transportation systems.

Cars are so embedded into American culture. To be completely honest, I look forward to having a car. In fact, the other day I was going on to my friend about how my car has to be electric because after taking this class, I was willing to do my part. Imagine my reaction when I read the title of this week’s lecture, specifically the part where it says “why electric cars are more trouble than good.” I was shocked, and that’s failure on my part for not educating myself on the subject. This lecture opened the lens even further that it’s not about perfecting cars but more about fixing our behavior, our culture. Undoubtedly there are more people like me who had the same mindset I did a few days ago, that electric cars are the solution, or at least a part of it. If only everyone took the time to watch this video. The way commercials and the general public stage electric cars as a savior adds to the problem too because there should be commercials promoting the benefits of public transportation rather than the freedom of a car. Taking this class was a great decision because it expands to my life outside just lecture. I’ve always loved biking and the manner UCSB and Santa Barbara allow for biking to be a huge part of its culture. However, it’s a switch a lot of people have to make. It’s not easy though, as a lot of people depend on cars to get to work, with the bus being insufficient. Sadly I depend on car rides like uber of lyft to take me to the train station, as biking on the road seems scary to me.

In this lecture, professor Hiltner bombarded us with a great deal of statistics to bring up the argument that electric cars are thought to be the solution for the carbon dioxide emission of normal cars but actually end up bringing more pollution. It is incredible to learn that the production process of electric cars emits 48-65% more CO2 than producing a normal car, and the replacement of electric cars is not really environmentally friendly as we think it to be. If we continue our lifestyle of car dependence, the task of mitigating the climate change within 2 °C will never be accomplished. Therefore, we need to turn to public transportations like buses, trains, and subways. This is becoming a normal routine for many people in big cities such as New York, Beijing and so on, but owning personal cars is still a thing that is so ingrained into our lives that making a major change would be a great challenge. Although it will be hard, it definitely needs to be reached for saving our planet and for our future generations.
</p><hr>


<p>
The statistic that buying a car every 11 years and just letting it sit in the driveway is more than the carbon emission allotment for someone’s entire life is really eye-opening. I do think that it is unrealistic to expect everyone to stop driving until we first get public transportation set up in an efficient way that people can get to work on time or school (which is also a huge part of social equality as well). I think that the first move is turning towards politics and getting a system in place where people can give up cars without having to add an hour for travel time to get downtown or without having to give up their job. 
<br><br>
Throwing shade at Elon Musk is an interesting idea. I personally never heard him refer to himself as a savior and I think that belittles a lot of hard work and effort he has put into starting a conversation about the climate crisis and about the environment. I don’t think Elon Musk ever claimed to be doing a perfect job at saving the planet. His career and companies have started a lot of conversations that are progressive in the direction of benefiting our climate and I don’t think that should go unaddressed. I think we should first shame and call out people who are intentionally harming the environment and manipulating information rather than people who are imperfectly trying to be on the right side of history. Why bash Elon Musk when there people doing way more harm. 
<br><br>
The fact that we have more cars than licensed drivers make sense but is so hilarious to me because it sums up America’s toxic material addiction so well. There is no reason to have more than one car. It is really interesting to look at the label of what is and is not ‘cool’ and how that influences the consumer’s decisions. I think that is where the power of social media can be used for good. To educate and encourage people to care about things and be an activist in their everyday life.
</p><hr>


<p>
While I agree that cars, electric or not, create a huge environmental impact on the environment and is a big financial investment to work off of, I can still see why many people buy cars as both a form of transportation and materialistic luxury. To begin, some places in the US do not have efficient bus or subway systems. Yes, big cities such as New York do have well set up subway systems that are efficient for many locals to use for work, school, and to get around places for leisure activities, but in areas that do not have stations and bus stops near them and have to walk 10+ minutes for their nearest station, and then have to transfer multiple times and walk to their destination, it can be quite a hassle. Moreover, public transportation can be somewhat inefficient in the fact that there are multiple stops (that might not even stop at where you need to go), unlike cars that take you straight to your destination comfortably and fast. Although all these reasons should not be excuses for why people choose cars over transportation, it helps understand why people use cars for efficiency, not just because they are “cool” (though this is a big factor as well). However, if we try to shift our priorities and understand that public transportation is important for the planet, hopefully there will be changes and improvements to public transportation systems all over America so people can take buses and subways with more convenience.

This video really makes me question everything. I was planning on buying an electric car when I could actually afford one to help reduce the amount of CO2 being emitted into the air.  I honestly felt confused when Ken first mentioned that it produces more CO2 during the production stage compared to regular gas cars. We were told that going electric would be the answer. That was the future. It is the smarter choice if you do buy a car but in reality if still harms the environment. Even car companies were advertising that they're safer for the environment. Now I realize they probably know they're producing more CO2 and just capitalizing on the green movement. I find it astonishing that just buying a car uses up all of the CO2 that we should be emitting throughout our lifetime, two metric tons per year. I do see how society has over hyped cars. I know this because my close friends are infatuated with cars and want to buy super cars when they get older.  Cars unfortunately a necessity as public transportation may take much longer than driving and much more of an inconvenience, especially for someone with no patience. Walking and biking are not as popular as well because let's be honest not many people want to physically exert themselves. Not only are we combating the issue of the climate crisis but we are also combating the norms that society has put in place many years ago.

I agree with you completely. Although public transportation and biking are great environmentally friendly alternatives to driving cars, I don't think the majority of the population would be on board to sacrifice their comfort, especially when biking is physically taxing for some, and public transportation takes longer and usually involves walking, waiting, and multiple stops. I also have friends and family who are very into cars, and it would be hard to convince them that their hobby is hurting the environment and they should stop. The other alternatives to driving are not very enticing to most due to the inconvenience and the idea of cars being "cool." Although these shouldn't be excuses for not switching to more environmentally sustainable modes of transport, it is understandable to why some people would not want to use these other forms of transportation. Hopefully we can change the culture surrounding cars and make public transportation more efficient in the following years.

Most people, with the development of technology, want faster. By that I mean people today tend to become irritated and impatient when things take too much time. I would know because I personally had to experience that especially with computers as back then you would have to wait for everything to load especially with opening Internet Explorer before Chrome was invented. The same concept applies to traveling. Society equates time with money and therefore in relation to a materialistic culture, people tend to desire faster cars. The fact is that the average American will produce 20 metric annual CO2 emissions and 4.6 metric CO2 on average per day. I was sort of surprised to find out that the production of cars also undergo a carbon emission process and how not using your car still leaves behind a carbon footprint. I really got to imagine how we would as a generation re-invent the stigmas around vehicles as a social status and it being cool. UCSB in comparison to other UC’s have a campus which there is an intricate bike path system where it becomes natural to ride bikes in comparison to having to drive around campus. This may be due to our campus being smaller than others but it is more environmental friendly that way to be able to bike or walk places instead of having to drive everywhere. The future of cars seem like it’s not going to stop at any moment from further development, but through electric cars it is a tad bit better although carbon emissions still come into play.

When I used to think of the U.S’s contribution to greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, I would think of the major fossil fuel companies, meat industries, etc. Though I wasn’t naive to the fact that my lifestyle contributed a lot to CO2 emissions, I didn’t realize how much my car—specifically—harmed the environment. Cars were never something I thought would impact our world so insidiously. Even if they were, I also believed that electric cars could be a solution to this problem. This lecture video showed me, however, that America’s outrageous consumption of cars is detrimental to our earth. Driving cars not only emit heaps of greenhouse gas into our atmosphere, but the production of them do as well. 
<br><br>
So now the question is why do we do this? Drivers know the answer. We love the idea of having something that is our own, something we can control, and something that runs on our schedule. This brings up the next question, though. Is it worth it?
<br><Br>
While I do think the stigma of public transportation being “uncool” is a significant factor for our major consumption of cars, I also think many people aren’t aware of the effects cars have to our world. If people are confronted with the horrible consequences of driving, maybe the stigma would change. People just realize that the luxuries we find “necessary” or “normal” must be sacrificed if we want to save our environment.

Well said! A lot of us are so thrilled at the idea of driving a zero-emissions vehicle because we believe we are doing something good for the planet that we don’t take the time to think about where these cars actually come from. Most of us fail to realize that simply driving electric cars does not help much, given that the amount of resources to produce these cars essentially have a similar impact and damage on our planet. I agree with your statement mentioning that the stigma of public transportation may change if people are given the facts on the awful effects of driving a car. I couldn’t have said it better myself! Great work!

This video was a complete shock to me. I did not know the amount of damage we caused to the environment just by having a car parked in our driveway.  We are only allowed 2 metric tons of CO2 per year and we decide to budget it very poorly. As mentioned by Ken with the possession of a car there isn't any room for clothing, food, and other necessities. The fact that we are influencing other countries to continue this plague to our Earth's environment. India has now become the fifth leading car market, and soon the number of cars will double to 2 billion.  I feel like without quantifying the destruction we continue to make we will not fully understand the impact of our choices. The fact that we have caused the car to become an image of freedom and define our position is truly astonishing. Our economy may have relied on this depiction, but our world depends on our conscious efforts in order to reduce our carbon footprints. We have created a judgment on those who decide to use public transportation- when they are contributing to a better tomorrow. We can't value a gas guzzling machine more than the Earth we share.
<br><br>
At this point in time we do not have any lingering time in order to battle and create an unrealistic solution such as a "zero emission" car. This will not cut it anymore; We can't continue to put salt in the wound when there is not a functioning solution. As Ken mentioned we must mix the humanities and STEM in order to create a better future for the upcoming generations. Why do we hope that one day a solution will arise out of nowhere and safe us all? Why don't we adapt small and maintainable actions into our everyday lives in order to combat this epidemic? Who will save us if we do not take action? The utilization of public transportation must be made mainstream and given a new connotation. Taking the bus can carry an individual 300 miles per gallon. The average for a car is 25 miles per gallon. The lack of efficiency is too stark to be ignored.
</p><hr>


<p>
n the video, Ken makes a good point that scientific and technological advancements are not enough to fight climate change. Technology has improved so much and has done so much for us that we fall dependent on it for saving us. Waiting for someone to come along and make the latest advancement that could possibly help, but scientific and technological advances alone will not be enough. As Ken mentions in lectures climate change is anthropogenic, the result of carbon footprints that people are leaving. Ken uses the electric car as an example to prove that science alone can not save the planet. Nowadays, we are dependent on other people like Elon Musk to come up with another invention like his electric cars that release zero emissions. That alone has convinced the public that all we need to do is switch over to electric, when in fact just the production of one car results in two metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Two tons of CO2 is the cap on how much we should produce a whole year, with just one car we have exhausted all the CO2 that we should use. We cannot wait for someone else to come along with a new technological advancement, because we do not have enough time to wait. Time is of the essence and we need to start taking action. Climate change was caused by humans and it must be addressed by them. We all need to contribute something if we want real change, this problem cannot be dealt with science and technology all by itself.

I also thought that it was important for Ken to highlight that climate change is anthropogenic because this blatantly brings the blame back to us as an entire population and shows us that we are responsible as a whole for making the changes needed to stop the destruction of our planet. This being said, I agree with the claim that we need to stop waiting for someone to "develop" technology to fix our situation  when there are things that we could actively be doing to help halt the climate crisis. Ken also mentioned that an old student of his said, "We need taking the bus to become cool, and owning a car to be anything but." I think this is a pretty bold but cool statement because it sheds light on the negative views most people have about public transportation, when in fact it is a method of transportation that would benefit the planet. I'm sure it's convenient to have a car, but people do not need to own multiples because that is only hindering our planet with excess CO2 emissions.

After watching the lecture video, I really like the idea of tackling our transportation system as a way to deal towards climate change. Respectfully earned, I am quite surprised that electric cars are having more trouble than good just like the rest of other cars. Hiltner did a great job in explaining why it is equally troubling to get an electric car despite the growing consumer based of the ‘zero-emission’ cars. As a suggestive solution, Hiltner stated that if we somewhat or somehow able to manage to switch our gears towards train transportation in manners that it will be seen as the ‘greater good’ overall than the typical automobiles, we would succeed in minimizing our carbon emission. Although this sounds like a pleasing solution, I believe it is possible to accomplish such a thing, however, It would take us the longer route, it will take us more time. Personally, As someone who is a California resident, having your own vehicle means the most to an individual in terms of convenience.I cannot simply blame people for owning cars just to get around from their everyday lives. Just like Hiltner said, Automobiles were illustrated throughout the years as something that is ‘cool’. On that point, I completely agree, if you look around our current society today, commercials that we see in tv, flyers we see in our mailbox, and even advertising of some companies or events, that sincerely utilize ‘brand new automobiles’ as a reward, is truly impacting. With that being said, I personally believed that the automobile industries are not going anywhere despite what Hiltner expressed in the lecture video. The automobile industries will adjust and find an environment-friendly method, utilizing our growing technology. However, I think it would be a great supplement to the transportation system if we somehow change our transportation through our transit system.
</p><hr>



<p>
Something I didn’t quite like about this lecture is that Ken consistently argued that Americans want to keep their cars because they’re “cool.” While I think that is part of American culture, I think more people are more concerned with convenience. Using the word “cool” seemed like a gross oversimplification of the matter. In the small town I live in, public transportation is almost not an option. I think I would have to drive to the nearest bus stop a town over, completely defeating the purpose. I also think this is the fault of city planning though. If public transportation was available to more people, especially people living in the suburbs, then I think families could or would be more willing to downsize to a single car and use other modes of transportation. Even then though, I think it is too idealistic to expect people outside of big cities to get rid of their cars anytime soon.
<br><br>
I also questioned how bad electric vehicles could be for the environment. I had heard the argument before that production of electric vehicles can release almost 50% (15-68% based on the video) more CO2 than the production of a gas running car from my dad, who happens to not believe in climate change. When I heard it from him, I thought there has to be more to the story. Once again hearing it from Ken in his lecture I thought the same thing, because why would we still invest in the production of electric cars if in its assembly stage they are already worse for the environment. What I found from a “Business Insider” article is that in a 2015 study from the Union of Concerned Scientists they concluded that “gas-powered cars [emit] almost double the emissions that contribute to global warming as electric vehicles, which can make up the difference from the manufacturing stage in six to 18 months of driving, depending on the size of the battery.” To me this sounds much better than a gas-powered car, considering over the lifespan of an electric car it will produce significantly less CO2 despite its initial impact. I also read that leading car industries like Tesla, BMW, and VW are working to reduce the CO2 emission from the battery production of electric cars, which is the most carbon demanding part of electric car manufacturing.  These industries have promised to solely use renewable sources of energy for battery production and also implement battery recycling programs.  The International Council on Clean Transportation estimates that these initiatives could reduce battery production emissions by 49%.
<br><br>
I wondered why I bumped heads with this video so much, and it easily could be because I am subconsciously afraid of giving up my own car.  Regardless though, I think it is possible to move away from personal vehicles in a push for more streamlined public transportation, just probably not in the very near future. I also think that electric cars should not be completely disregarded as an effective way to combat CO2 emissions.

<p>
I agree that we need fewer cars on this planet. If we could develop effective and efficient public transportation, and give personal cars the stigma of cigarettes -- things would be a lot better. I think in some parts of the country cars could get the cigarette treatment; it is completely uncool to smoke, and in places like New York or Portland, being a car owner could be seen as weird, unnecessary, gross, or even evil. But in places where public transportation is a hassle, or simply unreliable, cars will always be cool. Cars are honestly just better. I hate to say it but it’s true. You can play your own music out loud and sing along, you can drive with your friends and be noisy and talk about whatever you want. You can come and go as you please. Cars do provide a freedom that buses and trains are so far off from providing. 
<br><br>
Now, Ken did mention an interesting rebuttal about how one work day goes to paying for a car, and without a car payment we could have three day weekends. This sounds great in theory, but in reality, we will all still have to Monday to Friday. Your employer doesn’t care if you don’t have a car to pay for, you still need to be a full time worker. The other part of this that comes closer to reality is the idea that you could put that car money away every month and retire earlier. I won’t lie, this sounds amazing. That is true freedom. However, the caveat is that in that scenario, we are fighting instant gratification with delayed gratification. VERY delayed gratification. In the world we live in today, I don’t see the promise of an early retirement beating out the independence of a car.

There used to be a time when cars were the best thing since sliced bread. Now, looking at the impact that cars have had on contributing to C02 levels in the atmosphere, I think it's time to reevaluate our views. Before the lecture/video, I didn't really see giving up cars as a viable option. The truth is, if we all converted to public transportation , the planet would be a much better place. 1 bus could hold so many would-be drivers. Although we need to make people aware of the benefits of public transportation, its also important to try to change our cultural norms. We as Americans often look at people who take the bus and look down on them. Taking the bus simply isn't cool. Cars are in, cars are cool. Americans have always held the automobile as a staple of good lifestyle. Whoever drives the most expensive car is usually looked at with high regard and status. 
<br><br>
Before watching the lecture/video, I assumed that electric cars are the obvious solution to gas guzzling, environment polluting, expensive cars. After watching , Its now clear that electric cars do just as much harm. Because electric cars are out of the discussion as far as viable solutions go, we must resort to public transportation. It would significantly cut carbon footprints down. My only question about this is how effective it would be in rural compared to urban areas. For example, a small country town in Tennessee would probably have less reason and use for public transportation than a buzzing city like Los Angeles. Also, part of taking public transportation is getting to that transportation spot, and being able to physically walk from one destination to another. This is obviously gonna be a challenge for those who are disables or restricted to a wheelchair. Nonetheless, I hope that our society can make taking the bus or train the norm and I hope the change will save the planet.
</p><hr>


<p>
I believe that in order to see any type of positive climate change, we must completely change the way we live. Hypothetically, yes, there probably are ways that technology can help, but I just can not imagine those plans going into effect immediately. If we want a change right now we need to do something right now. The fact that we have so many other ways of transportation that require much less of a carbon footprint, but the companies have made it so popular to have access to “freedom” as Ken says, but you can literally get anywhere by walking, train, bus, etc. Maybe it is just laziness for not wanting to get rid of cars, but it would be so beneficial in every aspect, the only thing is maybe leaving a few minutes earlier. Even if we are not able to cut out cars, if we change other parts of our lifestyle it will make all the difference. For me, I do not have access to a car and I have not faced any difficulties. If we really want change then what is stopping us from taking action. Go vegan, thrift shop, cut down your use of cars! It really is not that hard if you set goals for yourself

Cars have long been a symbol of status in the United States and a culture dominated by  consumerism has made almost every American feel as if they need to have a nice car to be respected by their peers. This norm will make it very difficult to make the average American willing to forgo a car and bike or utilize public transportation instead. I think a potential solution to breaking this institution is celebrities advocating for more sustainable forms of transportation. I sincerely believe that if Kendall Jenner or Justin Bieber used their platform to promote the usage of public transportation, or biking instead of driving, people would take it to heart and change their ways. I think a massive factor in the creation of such a consumerist culture is falsely idolizing celebrities. I think it would be incredibly beneficial if environmental advocacy groups spent some of their funding on convincing celebrities to use their platform to encourage sustainable lifestyles. This may seem like a strange solution but people of my generation are very conformist in their ways of thinking and often blindly follow the trends of celebrities. To me, I think it would be wise to exploit my generation's flaw of following celebrities and work from the end of those with great influence to change the average consumers' lifestyle. 
<br><Br>
If the millions of dollars spent on the development of car technology were rather spent on shifting the way celebrities use their platform, I think there would be far greater progress towards limiting the average person's emissions. 
<br><br>
I agree that the industrial boom following World War 2 greatly shaped the culture of the United States into a direction focused on consumerism. Status became based on the possession of material luxuries. The notion of there being an "ideal American family" with a nice home in the suburbs, multiple cars and new domestic technology became widespread and supported the industries that desperately needed a large market following the end of the war. The legacy of this ideal not only powered capitalism in the United States but is also still having massive ecological consequences. Most people find it much easier to turn towards technological advancements to save the planet rather than change their lifestyles but the cultural change is so much more effective. I have finally realized this and feel personally responsible to change the way I live my life rather than wait for an Elon Musk type figure to save us; personal accountability is the only way we can defeat this crisis.

<p>
I completely agree and acknowledge that cars and their production are a big problem in regards to our carbon footprint and emissions into the atmosphere. It is--and should be--alarming that 35 metric tons of carbon is admitted into the atmosphere during the production of one SUV.
<br><Br>
It is, however, not alarming to me that with this in mind, people continue to purchase and drive cars several times, daily. If this SUV is someone’s dream car and they worked to save up for it, it is highly unlikely that they will not purchase this car when the time comes because of its contribution to climate change and the carbon that was emitted during its manufacturing. As Hiltner titles this video, climate crisis is a cultural problem. It can be said that your parents buying your first car at 16 and buying yourself your first car when you are an adult are two almost universal milestones in one’s life. For many, cars are seen as a symbol of one’s status, workmanship, freedom, personality, independence, and much more. Having a nice car is one of the first things that comes to mind when one thinks of a successful person in America. It is difficult to imagine this changing. Hiltner mentions one of his students saying that we need riding the bus to become ‘cool’, and while I completely agree, I don’t see how realistic this can be. 
<br><br>

If we were to look at this situation in analogy to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, I think that for many, caring about the climate comes after buying and owning a car. This is a sad reality but this is something I’ve noticed when it comes to how people think about changing their lifestyle for the environment. That is not to say that reengineering the cultural practice of car use is impossible, but it is likely to take very long to happen and simply difficult to imagine.
</p><hr>


<p>
I found it very interesting to learn about why cars are so valued in the United States. Like anything else popular in this country, the idea of owning a car was based on the idea of successes, of seeming successful that is. I mean, the average american follows a general path when it comes to success: like going college, getting a degree, having a family, and buying a house. So it’s no surprise that when the automobile industry sold the idea of having cars or multiple cars was additive to your success, then many americans bought this idea because nothing is more important than success right? 
<br><br>
Well fast forward 60 or 70 years and look at what all that amazing success has brought us, a deteriorating global climate. I think what frustrates me the most , is that now this generation is aware of what the consequences of having so much success ( material luxuries ) are, yet they continue to propagate the idea that having all these materials like cars or large houses is a measure of your success. This is a large cultural problem as it is environmental and well political. We have been raised with the same ideas of success like that of our parents or grandparents , and we continue to live unsustainable lives. Technology will definitely be of help, immensely, but if our consumerist culture and ideas of success do not change, then there is so much technology will be able to do for us in this crisis. 
<br><Br>
I have always thought that electric cars are like putting tape on a broken water pipe - a short term solution to a long term problem which in this case is our consumerist culture. Electric cars have less of a long term carbon footprint than gasoline cars, however, the problem here is that everyone wants their own car. Nobody likes the idea of public transportation, be it not liking to share a common space with other people or depending on the uncertainties of public transportation ( i.e. traffic delays). For mass transit to be successful we have to change the bias that it comes with, and support better mass transit infrastructure - and one can’t happen without the other. Quite a dilemma, but as we continue to ignore this crisis, and think this discussion is in our near future.

The line "the average American works one day a week to afford a car" is really heartbreaking to hear. Why ego we push ourselves, and strain our bodies to own an item that is literally killing the environment. If everyone could forgo their cars and participate in public transit the difference in the climate would be immense. Another fact that bothered me was the fact that electric cars, while they are better than regular gas chugging cars, is still not a solution to the release of CO2. In order to manufacture an electric car you are already releasing 2 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the environment. So at that point it really just comes down to how much we really want to make a change because on the track that we are on releasing 4.6 metric tons of CO2 a year rather than the recommended 2 metric tons a year, there won't be much we can do to reverse the damage on the environment.

Professor Ken mentions that the population of the US is not a large percentage of the world, but the numbers of cars are larger which stands out to me.  Also, " 85 percent of Americans use cars to commute" is a phenomenon we see every day, instead of public transportation. This phenomenon goes back to the US economy and society. Cars in the United States are fairly cheaper compared to other countries like China, Japan, due to that fewer taxes are levied on the price of the car; and there is an active and matured used car market where people can get cheaper and good quality cars. Behind the car industry, is the American lifestyle that people cannot live without cars. 
<br><Br>

Only a few cities in the US have a very urbanized city vibe which people in those cities are able to commute through public transportations or through bicycles.  The carbon dioxide from the emissions from the cars cost the environment downside. And even when producing cars, the car factories release emissions as well. But with such a large and lucrative car market in the United States that the factories only will keep producing cars and there will be more people buying those cars.

<br><Br>
Another fact shocks me is the emissions from producing electric cars. From knowledge to electric cars are limited and in my opinion that those electric cars are beneficial to the environment, and maybe the electric cars could be the solutions to car emissions. But it is the opposite, there is no way to avoid the emissions. People can start with little things, like carpool to school or work. Or even, live close enough to school or company that is able for people to commute through walking. However, there are constraints, like money or family. All in all, people should definitely drive less and the government should provide more convenient public transportations for the public.

I think the idea of electric automobiles shows how humans struggle to reduce their want for something and instead are doing anything and everything that can to try to replace it. But this lecture really places emphasis on whether or not that actually makes sense to do. Are we really willing to produce these electric automobiles, that cause so much harm to the environment, if that means we don’t have to give up cars? It makes me wonder why it is so difficult for humans to let go of something they have even if it results in negative consequences. I would assume that, with something like cars, it’s difficult for individuals to have a mindset that by them reducing their use, it would have any impact at all. This is why we so often hear, “everyone else is doing it, what difference does ONE person make.” But we need to start believing that actions of a few individuals can and will result in a chain reaction. This can even be applied on a larger scale. America is seen as one of the most powerful nations on earth, and has so much influence on so many other countries, like the increase of 10,000% in car ownership in China. This is why I believe that they need to take some responsibility as acting as a model for other nations. With great power comes great responsibility. We also can’t keep relying on technology to solve our problems, we really need to focus on our own actions, because quite frankly we are just postponing and change that can be made. 
<br><Br>
I also found the whole idea of cars being cool interesting, and the more I think about this, the more I realize how true it is. It is such a part of the culture here to become accustomed to driving at the young age of 16. Back home, you can’t get your license until you’re 18, and so many people I know don’t even end up getting it because it’s not seen as a big deal there. But it seems like in America, it is an important part of growing up, and everyone is always excited to get their license the second they turn 16. It’s clear that there needs to be a shift in attitude when it comes to car use, but how do we change the attitudes of people who just aren’t willing to change.

This is not a very new idea that Ken has presented to us in this video, that the climate crisis is largely a cultural problem.  He expressed this with the generational issue, the culture with the American Dream, as well as with the excessive consumer culture, and materialism.  However, Ken finally attacks it head on in comparison to the effectiveness of new scientific innovations.  I found it very interesting how the carbon footprint behind our transportation is largely due to culture rather than technology.  Even with electric powered vehicles, technology struggles to have the same effectiveness as culture does.  However, there is a large problem in the suggestion to move away from owning vehicles and to use public transportation.  From my personal experiences, public transportation is very underfunded.  Where I'm from, I live in a high-middle class suburban city that lacks effective public transport.  My friend who did not own a car would struggle and would sometimes just not go to school because of the frustration of how bad the public transportation is.  The nearest bus stop from my house is about a mile walk away, and the bus times are very infrequent and irregular.  Even in Isla Vista / Goleta / Santa Barbara, the public transportation can be frustrating as a bus may sometimes not show up on its scheduled time, making me late for class.     I usually bike at UCSB, but back home, I would not be able to bike 3 miles over large hills with all my books every morning, and neither could my friend who ultimately bought himself a car.  Therefore, i think the problem really boils down to the politics, where the public transportation is funded.  This can tie in to culture, as a change in culture could result with a change in votes and legislation, but my eyes are set on the government and its responsibilities for helping the climate crisis situation.

Growing up in SoCal, I can try and touch upon some of these aspects professor Hiltner explained. Specifically, in Southern California when has it ever been cool to take the bus, train or any public transportation system? Growing up here, society is so hung up on using cars over almost any other transportation that it has become the norm. The fear of getting into an automobile collision I think is outweighed by the fear of getting mugged or something on public transportation; that one hears about on the news. Along with this, SoCal having such a poor public transportation options, everyone residing in the area already does not want to go through the trouble of going through traffic when roads are shut down to make improvements for public transportation. Everyone is so stuck in their ways they commute, disrupting that flow is something they are not willing to do. That is why the luxury of owning and driving a car has now become a standard of life.

I really do agree with Kyle in the idea that any form of public transportation is seen as culturally uncool. Especially when cars are such a status symbol for those who have them. Cars are often a sense of pride for owners and thus it can only be seen that it would be difficult to deprive owners of their precious cars. Another thing that I found odd from Ken's video was his complete disapproval of electric cars. While it is understandable that he is urgent and abrupt about change and especially when it comes to such a large amount of CO2 that is released in the air through cars, I believe that electric cars personally are a good step forward. It would be difficult to accommodate even half of the population of many urban and suburban-type towns with the current transportation that is used today. Not only are they lacking in comparison to their city neighbors, it just wouldn't be reasonable to move that much of the population away from automobiles that quickly. Thus the idea of electric cars and the surrounding benefits that come with them seems pretty appealing from a normal standpoint. Understandingly, cars are much more important culturally here that in other places as well. Just as Kyle says, cars have become a standard of life and it would require a drastic action or influence to change that standard.

    The lecture "Why the climate crisis is a cultural problem (and why electric cares are more trouble than good" explained that manufacturing 'environmental friendly' electrical cars is not an efficient way to prevent global warming and more public transportations should be established to substitute usage of cars. Almost a quarter of the CO2 emission come from driving cars currently and ignoring that driving it, the production of a single car considering of the life-time of it has already surpassed the amount in order to control the global warming within 1.5 to 2 celsius. Thus even electrical cars can produce 0 CO2 emission, producing it already damaged the Earth a lot. It is every interesting and not understandable that the amount of cars in the U.S has even surpassed the amount of issued drivers' licenses and people should know that even you do not drive your car and only stop it in your garage, the production of it has already added 2 metric tons of CO2 to your account for 11 years. So the only way to solve this problem caused by using car is to build up more public transportation options such as buses, trains, and subways. More people should live to the suburban area and taking subways and buses to work instead of believing that car is the cooler option for them. Also, it can largely decrease the ratio of car accidents each years. Overall, using public transportation is the best option under the current situation.

Prof. Hiltner makes quite a few compelling points. Manufacturing of automobiles on its own is damaging to the environment; an issue that is overshadowed by the more obvious damage of using  a car. I was surprised by the numbers; the fact that buying a car without using it on its own surpasses individual CO2 quotas is quite amazing. 
<br><Br>
Car use reduction is a massive challenge in the US. In Europe, living without a car is possible for a large minority of the population – especially in Scandinavian countries. US’ geography is a curse in terms of the climate crisis, but not only. US roads were often build before cities, thus creating these massive sprawling urban areas consisting of low density neighbourhoods. Considering this, it is astronomically difficult to have even 25% of Americans limit their car use. Maybe technological change is a better alternative for a part of the population that really needs cars.
</p><hr>


<p>
After watching the video, I agreed with the major idea which is reducing the number of metric tons of carbon dioxide that people emit in their life. However, I disagree with nearly all of Ken’s ideas about the situation of the automobile in America. It is true that the number of automobiles should be reduced in America, however, this movement required two major changes which are reprograming the city and building the High-speed rail or just simply railway but much faster than the current railway. But, in order to realize these two changes, I am afraid that would emit more CO2. 
<br><Br>


From my perspective, it is hard to convince people who live in suburban areas to use public transportation. In order to convince people that public transportation has benefits, nearly all cities should be reprogrammed. Most population in the US lives in suburban areas which have a long way from people’s works. Public transportation in the transporting population at this range takes more time than the automobiles owned by people living in those suburban areas. In order to make public transportation more charming to people, it should benefit people in both economic and time, which means that cities should be reprogrammed to cities that have more population density. However, layouts of American style cities are hard to be changed. Or, on the other hand, changing the layout of cities to rising population density would donate more greenhouse gas to the atmosphere than people simply driving automobiles. However, if cities haven’t been changed, hardly could the government convince people who live in suburban areas to use public transportation, and hardly could people give up the comfort and time saving which given by their vehicles. 

<br><Br>

Based on my experience, the railway system in the US is shit. I spent 3 hours to take the train from Santa Barbara to LA. The distance of LA to Santa Barbara is only 100 miles and a little more. At this range, the High-speed railway system will only take 40 minutes. Or base on my experience of taking the normal speed train in China, this range will only spend no more than 2 hours. If I drive, it will take me 2 hours while counts on the bad traffic. How does the government convince people to take the train? There is no way that people choose to take the time-consuming train rather than cozy automobiles. 
<br><Br>


From my perspective, a likely solution that suitable for Americans is using K-Cars in Japan. K-Cars use only 1/5 of gasoline per mile compare to their counterpart which are automobiles that are widely used by Americans. Not only K-Cars consume less petrol, but K-Cars are also much cheaper and much easier to be produced. Although K-Cars look small and might be crowded inside, it is totally wrong to measure the interior space by looking at K-Cars just outside. K-Cars have inferior space no less than the Toyota Alphard series. I believe those advantages of K-Cars could draw people’s attention and help people to reduce their carbon emission per year.

Climate change is a huge cultural issue especially in developed countries in the world. Many people are so wealthy and entitled that they do not consider the consequences of their actions. Such as the negative effects of driving a car every day, or even just buying one. Many people do not think about all the emissions that come with the productions and manufacturing of a new vehicle. Cars alone account for about “a quarter of our carbon footprints” (0:40 Hiltner). Despite CO2 not being released from electric cars, these electric cars still produce up to “68 percent more greenhouse gases than a normal gasoline car when they are manufactured” (2:08 Hiltner). Ken makes the argument that even just buying a car every 11 years and not even driving them, will take up all of your CO2 emissions for your lifetime. I find it very fascinating that passenger trains are even more efficient than buses and cars. However, these forms of transportation have became the least desirable way to travel and it will only change if there is a change in the culture of places. However, it’s also very hard to take public transportation to go to specific places that you need to go to. Especially for rural or small cities. To a certain extent cars are necessary, but taking public transportation when possible should be encouraged and become the new norm.

This talk truly put things into point of view. I was, in the same way as other, under the feeling that owning an electric vehicle, for example, a Tesla or possibly a half and half implied I would accomplish something useful for the planet. Despite the fact that contrasted with the normal fuel-expending vehicle, a Tesla would be a superior other option, I didn't understand that just owning one and approaching your day by day life would in any case surpass the point of confinement of two tons of carbon dioxide discharges per individual every year. 
<br><Br>
I unquestionably bolster receiving open transportation, for example, transports, trains, and trams to get all around. In any case, I see a major issue with this on the grounds that in urban communities, for example, San Diego (where I'm from) and even here in Santa Barbara, these "wonder advancements" as Ken puts it are not common enough to make heading out to the supermarket or work advantageous.
<br><Br>
For non-renewable energy source organizations, this need to continually devour is a gold mine. We despite everything see this today. Individuals need significantly greater houses; considerably more pleasant vehicles. American's appear to be in a consistent challenge with each other, and it needs end. We have to begin concentrating on ourselves as people. We have to scrutinize our fundamental explanations behind needing these things. From that point, we can move onto activities that not just positively affect the earth, however on ourselves. Taking open travel isn't better for the earth, yet better for your wallet. The cash you spare from not purchasing a vehicle can be put towards things you really need.

In the town of IV, I truly agree that buses and bikes are the way to go when I need to get somewhere, but when I’m back in LA, it's the other way around. Not only because the area is much larger, also almost every household living in the area already owned a car (or cars), very little amount of people choose to take public transportation because automobiles are way more convenient. As for young people and teenagers like me, we might not own a car, but our parents or friends, someone around us will definitely own one, so most of the time, we just end up taking a ride on one of their cars.
<br><br>
Regarding the topic of transportation in the crisis of climate change , I agree strongly with Ken that what we need to do right now is stop spending more time on automobile (doesn’t matter if they are hybrid or electric), but instead switching our minds towards public transportation. We already have these technology waiting for us to use, what we need to do is advocate the benefits of buses, trains, and subways so that people are willing to let go of their automobile. It is not an easy step, but an important step we have to take.

In retrospect, all my life cars have been idolized as an absolute necessity. My parents always talked about when I would get my license and friends about their new cars. Never has it occurred to me that I simply didn't need one in my life. I think this idea works with many of the other points of emphasis in this week's homework. Cars are not a need but a trend in which the average American has been enticed by for the past century. Cars have never really been a necessity but we act as if it is due to the culture supporting it. I found it crazy that a single car alone releases 2 metric tons of CO2 , enough to cover our yearly capacity. What I found even more crazy was the fact that the average American expends 20 metric tons a year...This number is yearly unfathomable for me to process. Never would I have imagined that i could use CO2 hundreds of times my weight in a single year. 
<br><br>
I would like to note, however, that some people will never switch to public transportation. I think believing the optimal solution is for EVERYONE to stop using cars is extremely idealistic. This is why I still believe electric cars are an adequate solution in the short-run. Even if it doesn't nearly have the efficiency of a bus or subway, there is still some change occurring for the better. I believe incremental change should be emphasized more because that is the only way some people will actually change their daily routines and make change in the world.

According to Ken's lecture, I was shocked by the huge amount of greenhouse gas created by private cars and purchasing electric cars is not an environmentally-friendly choice. Also, with the development of technology and the economy, private cars became more affordable and necessary for people around the world. In other words, the efficiency of transportation is becoming lower and lower since most privite cars usually work for one person. I also surprised by the increasing amount of cars in China which is a 10,000% increase in the past three decades. In China, electric cars are advocated to be the best choice for the environment. The government gives a lot of welfare for people who purchase electric cars, including a free installation of chargers and some discounts on prices. All the implications are persuing people buy more cars. However, few people have realized that manufacturing a car can create much greenhouse gas and do huge harm to the environment. Maybe the best choice to improve the climate crisis is taking public transportations instead of purchasing private cars. Though traditional culture usually conveys that it is cool to own a private car,  we need to change the idea and make a difference to the climate crisis.

I have the similar idea. The video points out an important view that we overlooked before, which is the influence of culture on climate issue. Ken used the example of car to clarify his idea. In American society, travelling by car is considered cool. For many developed countries, the United States represents civilization and advancedness, so local people will imitate American behavior. In this way, the United States silently promotes the production of automobiles. However, travelling by car is not efficient at all. It produces huge amount of CO2 each year, which is extremely unfriendly to environment. Luckily, we have an easy solution, but it will cost a long time. Just like the way we shaped the image of driving a car as cool, we need to show travelling in public transportation is also cool to the public. Once such idea is formed in a certain number of people, it will quickly spread among society. However, many big industries will try to prevent this from happening for their own benefits. As a result, shaping enviornmental-friendly cultural practices will be a protracted war.

While watching this week’s lecture videos, there were many statements that were just astonishing. The first statement that struck me was how the typical car in the United States emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, which accounts for about 1/4 of the average person’s annual carbon dioxide emissions. If everybody took public transportation, or walked, or biked, that would do wonders for the climate crisis. In this week’s lecture video, I also loved how Ken talked about the benefits of not driving cars. For example, I feel like more people should know that many benefits come with not having to pay for insurance, gas, etc. With the money you save by not paying for automobile expenses, you would be able to retire at 40, instead of 65. In addition, not having to pay all of the car expenses would basically grant you a three-day weekend, every week. I feel that, if more people in the world knew about this, driving cars would be less desirable.

This lecture video was really eye-opening in many ways. It helped me understand how effective an electric car can really be. Electric cars help the environment in a lot of ways, but at the same time their production harms it drastically. For example, Ken described that to manufacture a Prius, it releases 17 metric tons into the atmosphere. This is almost as much as released by a car on average. This information has really gotten me to think more about my options regarding the way I travel. For example, right now I decided not to bring a car up to UCSB due to the fact that it costs a lot to maintain it, and I currently don’t have a job to support those costs. Instead, my methods of transport are using the bus or simply walking it to class. However, though I’ve been saving for my first car for a while though, but not until now have I really understood the grave effects owning a car has. Once I get a vehicle I would most likely exceed my yearly emissions, which is something we can’t afford to do with the current situation our planet is living in. This is why its important for me to have options; luckily the school is at a perfect distance from my residence and allows me to avoid contributing more greenhouse gas emissions to the environment. This lecture also made me realize how risky driving really is, with facts Ken mentioned like it being the leading cause of death in young adults, or how there’s more cars out there than licensed drivers. It has really gotten me to consider whether I should really get that car one day, as at the moment it really isn’t a necessity but more like a commodity/luxury.

The main idea I have learned from this lecture is that electric cars are never the solution to the climate crisis, instead, public transportations and the method to persuade people to use public transportations are the key solution nowadays. I have to say, U.S. still has a long way to go on public transportations, since buses or subways actually can’t cover many of the places. So, cars may be the most efficient way to go to many places. 
<br><br>
I am impressed by the good way to combine bicycles with public transportations like subways in Copenhagen. Since subways can’t reach everywhere and we often need to walk a long way after arriving at the nearest subway station. Many people nowadays know the importance of reducing the carbon emissions, but sometimes the inconvenience of the subways or buses may hinder our way to obtain the goal of taking public transportations or riding bicycles all the time. So, it is really a good way to combine the subways with bicycles. Also, in China, we use another more efficient way, which is called “Sharing Bicycles”. The bicycles have QR Codes, which you can scan it and the lock will be open when you want to use and when you arriving at the place, you can just lock it again and park it everywhere. This is also a quite good way to reduce carbon emissions and we don’t need to take our own bicycles upstairs or downstairs. 
<br><br>
Subway is now the most poplar and convenient transpiration method in China, and people will consider subway first when they decide to go out. And I believe it is a real good trend of the attitude and cultural change on vehicles.
</p><hr>


<p>
While I agree with the overall idea and goals proposed by Ken in this video, I disagree with a lot of the sentiments regarding car use being popular due to the culturally "cool" nature of cars. There are huge financial and safety burdens that come with owning a car,  but I would argue the much larger reason people use cars is due to the way our cities are planned and engineered. In San Diego, I drove to work because it took me fifteen minutes, as opposed to the hour I'd spend on an unreliable bus or trolley system and walking a mile or two between stops. Driving saved me over an hour and a half every day. Despite the fact I had to pay 4000$ for my car, ask my parents to cover the insurance, and paid to fill up my tank myself, the extreme convenience of having a car outweighed that cost to me. Things don't come fully down to financial cost; there are other hidden costs that determine what people choose. For  instance, I could have taken the bus and walked for only 30$ a month to get to and from work and school, but it would have taken up three hours of my day and I wouldn't have been able to make it to work on time. For me, the value of my time and effort was worth more than the monetary value of my car and gas. I see this replicated in less privileged low-income families in my city as well: they often found it necessary to own a car, and bought a cheap salvaged one to use. This, to me, says that urban planning today is a more pertinent issue for many people as opposed to the cultural "cool" factor of owning a car, because owning a car with the bumper duct-taped on or a severely dented body clearly stems from necessity and not the desire to look wealthy. 
<br><br>
There definitely are cases of people purchasing fancy cars that are environmentally detrimental for cultural influence, but I really believe that the solution to excess cars on the road is more infrastructure-based than anything else. This issue would be better solved by civil engineers, urban planners, and better public transportation routes rather than people trying to espouse riding their bikes as cool to do (which it totally is, but not a very effective solution in my eyes). There may be huge safety and financial costs to owning a car, but the ability to save time and energy is more of a factor in the average (read: non 1-percenter) person's decision to buy and use a car as opposed to the cultural idea that cars are cool.

I agree with your comment that driving is the most efficient way you can travel nowadays. I don't think the American people are willing to let go their freedom of owning and driving a car. I honestly think that the only way we can fight against climate change effectively is through technology. Ken says its probably more green to cut out cars entirely and change the culture behind transportation, but this doesn't seem effective to me. The reason electric cars are being developed right now is because more people are buying them, so it seem reasonable that current funding should be pushed toward electric cars. Public transportation is more eco friendly but it receives no funding to make it more time efficient and enticing to the public.

I think that this video had interesting points but I don't know if I can completely agree with everything Ken said. I definitely agree that we need to change our culture around cars and public transportation, but I can't help but think about how this may generate more environmental and societal issues. Again, I'm not saying that I think we should keep the model we have now, in fact I think that we should invest in public transportation and encourage the public that this mode of transportation will benefit them greatly. Although I think that the public should make this transition I don't think that this is a viable option for some people and their jobs. For example, policemen, EMTs, and firefighters are relied on by the public to get to dangerous situations in a timely manner, and I don't see how they would be able to achieve this without their work vehicles. Another thought that came into my head while watching this video is how the approximately 40,000 miles of interstate would become wasted space for the mass public if they had no cars to drive them. Converting this infrastructure into something new that would benefit the general public I'm sure would in some way produce CO2. Although I had these concerns, I still believe that it is important to make a shift in the way we travel and encourage more public transportation. I think many countries in Europe and Asia have a great model for public transportation and we should look to them to see how we can recreate this in America. One example I have personally traveled on are the bullet trains in Japan. This train not only transports mass amounts of people and is a much more environmentally friendly option but it is also extremely fast making it very time efficient. I think by investing in public transportation and making it a more desirable option, we can make major environmental impacts that will help combat the climate crisis.

<p>
I can’t say I’m surprised that cars have such a negative impact on the environment even when they are in their production stage. The first time I heard these facts was last quarter in English 22 and even then I thought that, of course, that makes sense. Something as big and powerful as a car would of course take a drastic toll on the planet. However, what continues to surprise me is how much people rely on their cars in the United States. But the reason people do rely on their cars is due to how shitty the public transportation system is. I come from a pretty big city but the public transportation in my city is absolutely terrible. Whereas it would take about 15 minutes to get somewhere by car it can take 45 minutes to an hour on the bus. After coming to UCSB and seeing that we have an efficient public transportation system I really wanted to go home during the summer and continue to use the bus. But after seeing how terrible it is I can see why people would rather take their cars then spend so much time out of their day waiting for a bus. 
<br><br>
Whenever I think about good trains or buses my mind always goes to other countries. Countries like Japan, South Korea, and Denmark have much better transit systems compared to the US. I wish we could take inspiration from these countries and improve our public transportation. However, that will not be easy because as Professor Hiltner mentioned in the video American’s are very attached to their cars. We tend to associate a car with freedom. When a teenager in America finally gets a car they usually think of all the things they’ll finally be able to do freely. This idea has been a part of our society and culture for far too long for it to disappear so quickly.

I have always known how much negative impact cars have on the planet especially during production. We share the fault in the destruction of the natural resources available on earth. While producing cars and other automobiles, it uses a large amount of steel, iron, plastics, rubber, and other materials. The labor in order to acquire these materials takes an effect on climate change through the use of equipment. Even the production processes also consume a great portion of energy which directly or indirectly affects the environment. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are the major constituents in the exhausts released by cars. The engines get worn up with time and they are unable to burn the fuel in the required ratio. This inability leads to the yield of carbon monoxide which harms the ozone layer leading to global warming. Shifting from using cars in our daily lives is a long shot but gradually it could happen. Changing how roads are structured to help the use of bikes, it could influence people to ride more bikes often. Primarily changing roads to increase safety. Another alternative is public transportation. The only reason I do not like riding public transportation is that it is dirty, I do not feel safe, and it's uncomfortable. Looking at other countries, the way they regulate public transportation is used more compared to the US.

I agree with the video that technology or innovation alone will not solve the climate crisis. It is excellent that people invented the "zero-emission automobile" as an alternative to carbon-based vehicles. However, there is no such thing as "the zero-emission automobile," which still has a lot of emission during its manufacturing process. Even though Electric vehicles reduce half of the emissions of gasoline, they are not our ultimate solution in regards to the climate crisis. A typical lifespan of a car is about 11 years; many people own more than one car or at least one, which causes this phenomenon of more vehicles than driver licenses. Additionally, they are many other people who don't like electric cars, which the technology of electric cars isn't solving the roots of the issue if we focus on car emissions. Car emission counts for a quarter of an individual carbon footprint, and we should look into the reason we rely on cars and not too much on mass transit. During the industrial revolution and post-wartime, a company works with politicians and governments to promote the freedom of driving a car, and people need a car to commute from urban to suburban areas. This causes an increase in demand for vehicles, and people begin to get used to the culture and love of owing vehicles, not just in the united states but around the globe.

<br><br>
Let's use public transportations more since it is more efficient and faster than traffic jams. Besides, environmentalists should work with the social science field to search for an approach that encourages the public to use more mass transit. It's almost a necessity for every household on the earth to have a car, but if this continues to happen, the carbon emission will only amplify even more. At least those people who live in the city should make better choices on transportation rather than relying on one's car.

I completely agree with Ken that solving the issue of CO2 reduction and transitioning from personal cars to mass transport vehicles like buses is a social science issue. Our current culture cherishes and worships having a personal car to get around. People like having their own car because they don't have to worry about sharing space with others and waiting for the bus or train to come at specific times and locations. At the same time, people also view public transportation as "not cool" and sometimes even considers it to be "below" them. This is the problem that must be fixed, and Ken is completely right that it is a humanities issue of trying to figure out why people come up with certain decisions in their heads. Even though cars have a history for being extremely dangerous, financially burdening, and economically harming people still buy them because they are "cool". People were bought into the appeal of the freedom that having a car brought them, but like Ken points out, the average person spends a day working a week to afford their car when they could save up and retire 20 years earlier than they do currently.

I strongly agree with the concept of getting people to question whether they should buy a car or not, however a conversation that for me should precede that one is the matter of providing people with public transportation to wherever they need. Several cities in the United States where built in function of car transportation, and not public transportation, which makes it really hard for people to make the decision as to not buy a car. They need to get to work, to go to the grocery store, or to the mall, etc. in some way and I believe it is the government’s duty to provide people with access to this. So before we question people’s thought process on getting a car, I believe we need to question politicians on whether they are giving the average American the means to make this choice.

<p>
In Ken’s “Why the climate crisis is a cultural problem (and why electric cars are more trouble than good),” the professor explores the damage done by electric vehicles to the climate crisis. Surprisingly, when electric cars are manufactured, obscene amounts of CO2 are emitted into the atmosphere. Ironically, a car normally advertised as “environmentally friendly” is having an extremely negative impact on the planet. To combat the pollution from cars while maintaining practical modes of transportation, Ken suggests making public transportation more mainstream and collectively utilizing it more often to avoid worsening the atmosphere. However, in my opinion, this will be a difficult goal to accomplish because cars provide people a certain independence that public transportation can’t give.

This video is disheartening, because I can relate to it on a personal level. Manufacturing a car releases too much CO2 to be considered environmentally friendly. This makes me sad because my dad has a Nissan Leaf, and is very proud of it. He loves to tell people how much his all electric, zero emission car, helps the environment, and convinces other people to buy them too. Finding out that electric cars are not what I believed they were was very disappointing. This makes me wonder the motive behind electric car manufacturers is, and if they understand that their cars are really not environmentally friendly, even though they market them this way. Is this another corporate game to make money off of gullible people in society? Sadly, I think so. 
<br><br>
Shockingly, there might be two million cars on earth in the next 15 years, doubling the huge number it is now. We need to “reengineer the cultural practice of car use,” as Ken says. We are wasting our precious time on finding a zero emission car, but this is not very probable, considering that a five thousand pound car manufactured for one person is not environmentally friendly. 
<br><Br>
We need to shift our focus onto making public transportation “cool” and even preferred. We need people to understand that we can live our lives without the personal ownership of an automobile. Additionally, cars make up one fourth of CO2 emissions, and have an annual mortality rate representing that of an epidemic. Financially, environmentally, and safety wise, cars are not cool. However, our society has convinced us that cars determine our worth in many ways. 
<br><br>
The future of cars appears to be growing; however, this is the opposite of what should be happening. Living our lives without change in this new era is not an option. We must change the way we live in many aspects to begin to lower our carbon footprint and hopefully reverse anthropogenic climate change. We must use public transportation, and we must understand that the ownership of a car is very costly in many ways. We need to ask ourselves if it is worth it to own cars, knowing the costly effects they have had and will cause. In a perfect world, the answer for many would be no, it is not worth it.

Even as an avid car enthusiast, especially the ones that happen to not be at all emission friendly. I completely agree with everything stated in this video. While cars are definitely "cool" and extremely convenient, their effects on the environment are not. The way current society and cities are planned out make cars an almost must have in most places in the country. I knew that cars were of course bad for the environment, but I was unaware of just how much emission they create in the process of being built. Buying a car and never even driving it releases an absurd amount of co2 into the atmosphere and with the amount of cars created it is no wonder they make up so much of the global emissions. 

<br><Br>
For cars to be not as necessary, many cities have to have better public transportation systems. In Los Angeles, where i've lived my entire life, I have only ever taken public transport once. It is not as luxurious as a car by any means if a car is available. Ken stated that without spending money on a car, one could work less and still save more money. This is an interesting statistic to consider, but I wonder how true it is if buying a reasonably priced car (compared to income) that is efficient. If the difference is not too big, I might consider how much id be willing to pay to have a car, versus having to rely on public transport. Even with a high price, I personally would like to still have a car even with their effect on emissions. Unless public transport is massively upgraded and made more convenient,  it would take a lot for me to willingly take a bus to and from everywhere I need to go. Another aspect of relying less on cars is the amount of jobs that would likely be lost. The automobile industry is one of the biggest in the world and employs around 8 million people within different sectors. Ideally it would be great to reduce the use of cars, but I feel like that is a long way away. I know currently manufacturers are being pressed to reduce emissions, which is a start.

<p>
The fact that simply buying a car every eleven years maxes out our carbon footprint of a lifetime- and that’s not considering any other emissions factors such as waste and food really brought the whole automobile/ climate crisis relation into relativity for me. Growing up in suburban America, it was uncommon for anyone not to own cars, and for those who didn’t have a convenient ride, uber and lyft would always be considered before public transportation. Because of this, owning multiple cars per household was a norm, and although schools preached biking and walking, using automobiles as the main source of transportation was unavoidable because it’s already ingrained into our culture. Even if everyone knew just how damaging cars are to global net emissions, it would still be extremely difficult for everyone to make a transition, since that would require changing up their set schedules around work/ school/etc. Additionally, I thought it was interesting how the whole car situation related to the climate injustice problem.Majority of car owners are first world residents who are privileged enough to live comfortable lives, yet less affluent nations and people suffer the most from the effects of climate change. It’s so messed up that the luxury of first world countries (coal, transportation, beef) are the leading cause for the climate crisis.

<p>
It is interesting to me that so much of the emissions cars are putting out into the environment are from the manufacturing process of actually producing the cars in the first place. I feel as though this fact is completely overlooked when it comes to electric cars and cars in general because people always just focus on the emissions from the time you spend driving and what kind of car you have, not the process of creating the parts. It is interesting to hear how much better electric cars truly are in terms of the emissions that the cars let off in their lifetime, but it is also an important point that these cars aren’t great for the environment either. I agree with what Ken said about people deciding to soon to get electric cars, and it also makes me feel as though the electric cars are somewhat of a trend that some people like to follow. I have come across several people in the past couple of years boasting that their parents have electric cars despite them not knowing any of the facts or benefits of them at all. It is also interesting to think about the waste that would be created if everyone were to switch from the cars they have now to electric, and makes me wonder if someone will create a revolutionary idea that can turn traditional cars into electric cars and in turn would save (literally) tons of waste.

I am extremely mind-blown by this lecture. This is the most mind-boggling lecture thus far. I really did not realize how economically unfriendly cars were. Recently, I have been finding cars more cool (because of their symbol of freedom and independence), and have begun to dream about owning my own Tesla (or anything equivalent to that) one day. I have yet to get my drivers’ license, and hoped to get insurance soon after. The main reason I have not gotten my license is because it’s too costly for my family to pay for my insurance. My hometown is also in San Francisco, in which I really do not need a car to get around. I used to fear driving, and was reluctant to the idea that it would be my destiny. Because of my experiences with other young people wanting the same kind of freedom and independence, I can see how my view of cars has changed over the past few years. Now, I am utterly disgusted. I am glad I saw this video now, before I came close to getting a car myself. Now, I wonder if I should even bother getting a drivers’ license, because I hope that soon our culture will actually shift in favor of the planet. I realized, however, that another reason why I wanted a license in the first place was so that I could apply to certain jobs on campus. This led me to believe that this is another aspect of our culture that we’d have to change in order to make people feel like they don’t actually need cars. 
<br><br>
After hearing about the production and life cycle of cars, I wonder: What’s the best thing to do with existing cars? If we don’t use them, they won’t contribute further to climate change, but they will just take up space and collect dust. If this were a matter of clothing, I would donate or sell it without hesitation. But if someone else uses the car, then what’s the point of me not using it myself? I know it would also take extra energy to recycle car parts -- but if it’s used for something more environmentally friendly and if it’s also recycled in a way that won’t produce a significant amount of GHGs, maybe that would be the way to go. My family currently owns three cars, which we definitely do not need. I would love to share this lecture and also a plausible solution for what we can do with at least one of the cars.
</p><hr>

<p>
While a car might not be good for the environment, making the statement that all Americans should just get rid of the cars is frankly naive. While that solution might work in a perfect world, our society is anything other than perfect. It is simply unfeasible for many people to rely solely on public transportation. In Los Angeles, for example, traveling from one side of the city to the other can take about an hour on public transportation, and that doesn't include the time it takes to get from your home to the bust/train station and from the station to your final destination. If you add in those times, it can take someone well over an hour to get to work when using a car can cut that time in half. Using public transport can therefore result in over two hours of commuting time every day, in addition to an 8 hour work day for those who have a full time job. I believe finding a way to produce cars more efficiently and producing more efficient cars is a much better way to reduce our climate footprint than to just tell everyone to forget what has become a necessity.

I am honestly just sitting here unable to come to terms with the fact that electric cars are bad for the environment. I feel like I have literally been lied to. Why is everyone promoting the production of something that promotes environmental benefits that are completely false? Who is in charge? Why is Tesla praised?  
<br><br>
Oh my goodness. I make my comments throughout the video and the fact that he mentioned a Range Rover. I feel targeted. That has always and will always be my dream car. I am ashamed but I really would not feel my life was complete if I didn’t have the opportunity to drive one. Man, are they bad for the environment though. 
<br><br>

I guess it is a shame that 5000 pound vehicles are created to support the travels of one person. Who ever thought that was going to be a good idea. In my head, I think though that to get rid of cars, we have to have way more big cities. The gas and trash found in cities is far worse than in the suburbs. I don’t think that the creation of cities is environmentally sound either therefore I would see it impossible to eliminate cars all together. Cities apparently though are more efficient so maybe it is possible. It is also very expensive. 
<br><br>

The question Professor Hiltner proposed which was “why does America drive SO many cars,” stuck out to me. This is because many of the families from my hometown own more cars than there are people in the family. They have cars that end up just sitting in garages waiting for the day when someone will take them out. How does that affect the environment? I guess the only bad thing would be the complete waste of creation if they will go without usage. But why do people buy new cars and why aren’t they getting rid of the old ones?
</p><hr>

<p>
I believe that cars are more efficient in a person's life than a bus.  However, I know that buses and trains are way better for the environment but they are not as efficient in a person's life.  There are not enough buses and stops to be efficient in an average busy day in a person's life.  A car is always right at your house available whenever you need it to be.  Also, a car can get them to their location faster than a bus.  A bus has stops which could be inconvenient if you do not need to stop there a car could just pass the stop and still be on the way without spending the time to stop.  If the person has a lot of stops on the bus to their location then a car would be better for them because they would not have to make unnecessary stops along the way.  One could also drive faster in a car than a bus.  A bus usually drives slower because of all the people on the bus and they have to be very careful.  

<br><br>
Ultimately, I do not think the change in transportation is going to happen anytime soon.  I even think that cars are becoming even more popular due to new technologies and designs in and out of new cars.  I think the facts against cars are great but sadly will not change the opinion about cars in other people's eyes.  I think the interest in these new cars is too strong for people to say "I think I want to take the bus" because their car has all these features and designs that make the bus unappealing.

I really like your comment because he acknowledges how great mass transportation would be, but also how unrealistic it is for a lot of people unless they are that determined to incorporate into their lives. However, even if you can’t take mass transportation every day, it’d still help make a small impact if we did it as much as possible in our lifestyles. I agree that the change in transportation will not happen anytime soon. In my high school, most people got a car as soon as they were legally able to drive, if not before. This just shows how the economy for individual transportation is expanding rapidly in America as more and more people purchase these convenient vehicles. The companies producing these cars are specifically targetting consumers very well, with all the innovation and luxuries that buses do not have. It’s important to think of how ignorant we are in terms of our lifestyle. Convenience is so important to us, and buses and trains just do not provide that. 
<br><br>
 I think eventually people will start taking mass transportation more and more in the future, but it will be a very gradual change. Other factors, like traffic, will eventually be too much to handle for the average driver. Already in the Bay Area, traffic is overwhelming and is taking over so much time in many people’s lives. The commute for many of my friends’ parents to work was more than an hour because of traffic when it should’ve only been about thirty minutes. This encourages people to take trains, because they are not sentenced to wait in that horrid traffic overtaking the roads of Bay Area. Mass transportation will become more prominent, in my opinion, and will be beneficial to the environment but I believe it will be out of convenience rather than any care for the environment.

Undoubtedly, Ken was right evidenced by his data and analysis. However,  the problem is how can we let people learn about this issue and how can we convince them not to drive. To be honest, driving was the most efficient and fast way to go from one spot to another. In the US, public transportation was not efficient enough to get people from one spot to another fast and efficiently at anytime. Therefore, sometimes we do not have another choice except buying a car. Even though we knew that is so environmental unfriendly even. we just buy one, people can not abandon the convince cars take to us. To my perspective,  solving this problem is the most important part of solving the whole problem.

<p>
For me, this subject is a tough one, as I cannot really imagine my life without access to a car. First off, I strongly dislike the idea of living in a city. Whenever I am visiting a large city and stay there for periods of time, I feel claustrophobic, uncomfortable, and I really feel like I need to get away, out into the open nature with no one around. My favorite places in the world to be are places where I am alone or with a few other people in nature, a rural locale. Surfing is one of the greatest joys of my life, and there is nothing like surfing great waves in picturesque nature. Even here at UCSB, having access to friends with a car is a very freeing feeling that feels very healthy for me. I love going surfing down south a little to Ventura where the waves are typically bigger or heading up north towards SLO where the waves are also good and unpopulated compared to Santa Barbara. Heading up the Santa Barbara mountains with my friends is also a very freeing feeling. With cars, I have been able to surf, explore mountains, and find other amazing nature - which has led to my passion and love for mother earth and the environment - therefore contributing to my environmental consciousness. 

<br><br>

Furthermore, when I am older, I am very sure that I will not be living in a city, and instead a more rural locale, as I simply like being alone and not around many people. Without a car, I'd say this lifestyle is very hard to live, but also, looking at the bigger picture, it may be a sacrifice I have to make to help the planet. Public transit is great, but will there be buses and trains going to unpopulated places in the countryside where there isn't a great demand to go to? 

<br><br>

I also find Ken's argument somewhat exaggerated. Yes, the retire when you're in your late 40s compared to 65 sounds great, or having a three-day weekend instead of buying a car - that is a very fair and enticing argument. However, yes, cars do injure and kill a significant amount of people, but they are not as gnarly as the crazy death machines wreaking havoc that Mr. Hiltner makes them out to be. And cars do offer freedom to pick up and leave at any moment and drive to somewhere peaceful and beautiful. 
<br><br>


Ultimately, this will be a tough problem for many people to face. As I myself have demonstrated, cars are very ingrained into the DNA of Americans and they have a very enticing image - who can deny the appeal of being able to go where you want when you want to at the turn of a key? However, they pose a significant problem regarding climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, and they are not necessary to have to live a happy and fulfilled life. I know I can go without one and still be happy, but the experiences cars afford have been some of the best of my life.

I agree with you in that cars are a huge part of my life, from spending all of my free time around them modifying them or using them to go on road trips with friends they are almost always playing a role in my adventure. But the sad reality is that these beautiful machines are taking a very harsh toll on our planet and greatly worsening climate change. But dropping cars completely and moving to public transportation is much too drastic of a change for our society to handle. Many people depend on their cars for commuting to work, visiting family, and going on weekend adventures. This is why I believe it is essential that we move forward with companies like Tesla and other auto manufacturers that are developing electric cars. As they still may be producing plenty of greenhouse gases during their production process it is still drastically lowering automotive gas emissions as they will never have to fuel up. This serves as a perfect way to transition our society into a more ecofriendly style of living as we can step by step move from gas cars to electric cars to potentially only electric public transportation. I personally can never imagine a world without cars but mother nature's lifespan seems to be ticking and adjustments need to be made somewhere

I like this video so much. I like one statement that stated by Ken so much, that "Climate crisis is a cultural problem". A lot of Americans own a vehicle because of the cultural impact not because they need one for daily use. As in American culture, having a car means that you are free and grow, you can do where ever you want. In the U.S, when the time you get your car and driver license means you become an adult. Buying and owning a car is not only a daily usage but also a symbol to show you become an adult. In my high school in Peoria IL, every student owns an vehicle, even some of them just live 4 minutes away from school. Therefore, I really hope people can think about that and start to reduce to buy a car for a meanless reason. And start to use more public transportation.



</p><hr>

<p>
After watching this video, my own answer for the title has come up, which is that people who trying to make a change against climate crisis through technological improvement on cars with less emission and less consumption should foster a culture that taking bus or walking is cooler than owning a car. The number of automobiles soared in the last few decades and this trend will continue in the future, which causes overload for our planet, because the most energy-saving car would contribute some emission while it was manufactured or steered so that what we should do is to make an effort to minimize sales volume of cars and advocate citizens to take public transportation. Only by this way can we slowly eliminate the fact in US:"in the US we have more cars than we have license drivers."

I agree with you that the impact of our current culture ultimately reverses the intentions of technological improvement of cars as our carbon footprint would shift from driving gas based cars to making energy efficient ones. We have to start a trend toward shared transportation such as subways, trains, and efficient ones such as biking. If we fail to do this, our carbon footprint will never truly reduce to what we need it to.

This week’s lecture video really made me feel bad. It amazed me to learn that an average driver’s car emits almost twice the amount of CO2 emissions that we should emit per year. Just the car. I am going to call myself out and admit that I own a car, brought it here to college in hopes that it would be beneficial, to only use it once or twice per week. My next thought after realizing that a quarter of my annual carbon emissions comes just from my car usage, I would be interested in electric cars and their “zero emission” mantra. However, as Ken stated, as they are the better alternative to their counterparts, the production of these cars contribute more CO2 than they let on, producing almost two metric tons. This does not sit right with me because out of all of the things Ken proposed to make progress toward lowering our annual CO2 emissions, this seems the most unrealistic to accomplish on a large scale. It would take a massive shift in perspective of cars, their usage, and their value to persuade Americans to ditch them and seek alternative transportation methods such as buses or trains. This truly is a cultural and societal issue. If only the climate change denier team who shifted America’s view on the climate crisis from consensus to skepticism and denial can help us out with this problem. I agree with Ken and the points he makes, but the benefits he gives to alternative transportation are, in my opinion, somewhat weak if being used to persuade the average American to reconsider their car usage. Every other suggestion seems easy until this one because I had already stopped doing most of those things. Attempting to lower my CO2 emissions through my car usage will definitely be a challenge, and it shows that doing something beneficial for the environment is difficult when its something so integrated into our lifestyles.

I agree that this idea that a quarter of our co2 emissions acmes solely former car usage and that electric cars and companies like Tesla that are praised for  their advancements in technology, lowered consumption of co2, and promotion of saving the environment are incredibly shocking and saddening.  It is scary to think that the government truly can promote whatever they choose and ignorant Americans will buy it with no evidence or fabricated evidence. The fact that they were able to convince us that electric cars were so much better for the environment and successfully able to hide the true facts that they truly are not is amazing in a very negative way. Why doesn't anyone know this? Why is no one talking about this? In today's world it is so hard to know what to believe ad follow because there are so many opinions and falsified evidence out there. How are we supposed to save the earth if the ways we are being told to save it are false?

<br><hr>
I completely agree. It is extremely frustrating to discover that a lot of things we are being told are hidden in very important lies. And yes, it makes it so hard to do the right thing and practice what you preach when there is just so much that is hidden from public knowledge. We can try our best to do our own research and base our decisions off of that, but at this point I am probably going to be second guessing everything I learn. It is extremely frustrating. Personally, I just have to find in my heart and mind to believe that I am doing my best to change my ways for the better and that it is making a difference.

<p>
One of the points that you made that I overwhelmingly agree with is that even though cars are claimed to be a necessity in modern society, the reality is the exact opposite. Not only does public transportation reduce the amount of people on the road individually, but it proves to be much more fuel efficient in travel methods such as buses, trains, etc. Promoting this as being more culturally acceptable, or "cool" in our society would greatly reduce the U.S. per capita carbon emissions, and could reduce it all over the globe if other countries began to follow suit.
<br><br>

Many climate change deniers would see this proposition as an attempt to place heavy limitations on personal freedoms. But how would these freedoms be limited if they could travel the same places they were going to in the first place, just on public transportation instead? Sure, it would take a bit longer than a normal vehicle would, but that comes at no cost in comparison to the amount of aid that we would be providing to the planet. The fact that public transportation would cost much less than owning/maintaining a personal vehicle just serves as more motivation to make cars a thing of the past.
<br><BR>

One obstacle seems to be present in this proposition, however. How can we actually prove to the public that public transportation is actually more culturally appropriate than cars? Many would say that we just need to devise a way to make it seem more "hip" or "cool" than conventional travel, but I think presenting people with the facts about its fuel efficiency and environmental aid would prove to be much more effective. For instance, I had no idea that trains could travel that far on saving that much fuel in the long run. If more people were to become aware of this information, then maybe we could help phase out car use on the individual level.

Ken in the video explains why even electronic cars cause more climate problems than anything else. VW thinks that electronic cars are really zero carbon products, but in fact, they are not. The total carbon emissions used to produce electronic cars and their own carbon emissions are even more than that of ordinary cars. However, if you really want to buy a car, electronic cars are more recommended, because the annual carbon emissions are actually less than that of electronic cars. Ken also mentioned that the key to reducing carbon emissions and environmental issues is not technology and technology, but the concept of humanity. For example, to really reduce the carbon pollution caused by cars, it's not really to solve the problem of high carbon emissions of cars, not to devote more carbon emissions to make cars with less carbon emissions, but to fundamentally change people's thinking, let them feel that it's cool to ride a bus, which should be advocated, but not to be a car.
<br><br>
At the same time, excessive love for cars also brings problems to people's life safety. There are countless car accidents every year, especially among young people. The number of cars in the United States is even more than the number of drivers with driving licenses, which is why the problems caused by cars are more serious than other factors.

I know we need to accept these changes in order to mitigate climate change, and many people already have. What worries me more is the fact that our society as a 'united' nation will not change so easily. We live in a capitalism society and that means consumerism is basically the backbone of our economy. It makes more sense that the popular changes that people make are buying solar panels or buying electric cars. While these seem like a good idea to help the environment, it comes down to the reality that these all must be manufactured and transported or shipped all across the country. All of this is part of industrialization and how our society today was built on that but it's just not sustainable anymore and I'm not sure how we can change when the people in charge are still stuck in the past. If on average owning a cars requires one day of work per week, and we got rid of cars, we could have three days weekends every week. Imagine how much quality time you could spend with your family or planting a garden or walking through the park. In order to make this change together we need to reevaluate what we really care about and also explain to Americans that owning a car or 'stuff' in general isn't going to make us happy! We can find happiness in so many other ways and have to work less. Who wouldn't want to cut the cord of our attachment and reliance on materials? A big part of our society today is media. It's probably the easiest way to infiltrate the minds of millions of people. We could use it to sells new cars like we do now or we could do it to show ads for public transportation, trains, buses, etc. How public transit can be 'cool'. Being 'cool' can also mean saving the planet right?? Although you might have less control if you don't own a car, that could also be looked at as a positive. You don't have to pay for gas, pay for maintenance and deal with all the frustrations of buying/selling, as we'll as driving in traffic or bad weather, not to mention the fact that cars always depreciate in value.

After watching "Why the climate crisis is a cultural problem", I was surprised that it changed my attitude toward electric cars thoroughly. Cars are the main discussing topic throughout this whole video, they are the direct damaging contributor towards our planet. Before watching this video, I strongly believed that electric cars are the best choice for today's society since they are "environmentally friendly" and "no CO2 emission". For instance, the core ideology for Tesla is what it is called "zero-emission" which means there is no fuel emission into the atmosphere. Due to this "attractive concept", many people begin to replace their fuel cars into Tesla or either purchase one as my parents did. Both my parents and I believed that electric cars can help to reduce fuel emission which is a good factor for protecting our planet.  However, I found out it was totally wrong after watching this video. Manufacturing and constructing a car could leave behind tons of CO2 footprint. As Tesla has gradually dominated the car market, especially in California, as a research revealed that every 10 cars three of them are either Tesla or other electric cars. Most people hold a positive attitude toward electric cars since they believe they are much better than regular fuel cars. From my perspective, it is extremely necessary to spread Ken's view to the public and letting them understand the best way to protect our environment is to reduce car driving no matter if it is electric or not. What's more, it is better for the government to construct subways. For instance, Beijing, the place where I was born and raised, did quite well in building up several subway lines. As Ken has mentioned, Americans rely on cars for their living. Now, I think it is time for American people to make some improvements and changes toward public transportations. This movement could not only contribute a positive effect into our planet but also reduce CO2 emission. It is the time to advocate this truth of climate crisis toward electric cars.

Growing up in East Los Angeles, the LA Metro and buses were a big way to get around. Even today, there is a big push for these forms of transportation in favor of cars, to lessen the traffic of Los Angeles as well as ease the levels of CO2 emissions and for the pollution occurring. As mentioned in the lecture video, these are the most efficient forms of travel. Cars, just by themselves and not being driven, emit 2 metric tons of CO2 in the environment. That on top of the emissions from the car when they are driven are detrimental to the environment. The smog in the LA sky is directly caused by how many cars are on the road and all the industrialized firms. Los Angeles is one of the biggest cities in the world, with the greatest traffic, and just another example of city that over relies on cars for main methods of transportation. The environmentalist me is all for mass transit and a shift away from cars, but there is a realist in me that knows that it will be incredibly difficult and may be entirely impossible. Mass transit in cities like Los Angeles and New York can be so dangerous, with many chances of child abduction, sexual assaults, battery, theft, and other things. Of course, these incidents can happen off and on the bus and train, but it is still a big wall of fear people will not go over. Personally, I have no issue traveling by bus or train, but I know many who are scared or had traumatizing experiences and will instead take their own car or uber to a destination. Also, there is the barrier of convenience for others. As mentioned in the video, traveling by bus in suburbs is often so underdeveloped and unsupported that it takes forever to get to your attention. Major cities have a transportation that is much more developed of course. I moved away to a suburb after Los Angeles, and traveling by own car is often the easiest way to get around. There is only one bus in the city with only few stops in the main parts of the city. It is great for traveling from city hall to the stores, but what about the residential areas? If major powers and advocates for public transportation want more people ditching cars, they need to do far better at developing the system and connecting to residential communities more. Also, there is the culture aspect to address. Many see the car as a symbol of freedom, which I still see it as; one could go anywhere, from the beaches to the mountains. The car is also a symbol of hard work paying off, as people save and can use the money from hard work at a job to buy a car. This culture aspect will be another thing to tackle for advocates as well.

Probably one of the most interesting arguments that Ken makes in this video is with regards to the fact that the manufacturing of electric cars generates more CO2 then the manufacturing of fossil-fuel cars, and that ultimately, making a more fuel efficient car is still asking the wrong question. Cars kill nearly 40,000 people per year, and yet, particularly as Americans, the car is seen as an extension of one's personality. I have plenty of friends in my fraternity that are always drooling over the newest models of cars, how good a car is at off-roading, and how fast a car can go: all without a thought given to the price of these cars or how much a fuel efficient car or, better yet, a train or bus, will save you. Having come from Chicago to California, I get the sense that people here are heavily dependent on their cars in a way that I am just not used to. And as a result, I see the necessity of having a conversation around car use. 
<br><br>
 One of the main reasons why people my age die in car accidents is because of phone use. One of the main complaints people older than me make about their commutes is that they wish they could be doing just about anything instead of driving. Taking a train solves this problem. All you need are some headphones and a solid internet connection and you could be reading, texting, or watching anything you want without a thought of danger. Yet, car use is still so inextricably tied to life that most people would never consider giving it up. What this means is that, either we need to make car use hard, or make train use really, really cool. And, for some reason, I dont think its that hard. Sure car companies can keep making their teslas and prius, but that won't change the ease and cost of Amtrak. Through a concerted effort, I think people will be able to make amtrak convenient and popular, we just need to envision it and come to that conclusion in the first place.

I personally find cars to be a very two-sided argument. First, they are horrible for the environment even if you don't drive them. As Ken said, if you buy a car and just let it sit in the driveway you will have already expended your allotted amount of CO2 for your lifetime. This means that just the production of cars is emitting a large amount of CO2 into the atmosphere. This is why electric cars do not solve this problem. So after watching this lecture, it is clear that the best thing to do would be not to even own a car but how can we do that when there is not another way to get around. In many parts of the U.S., there is not sufficient public transportation, it's not reliable or it’s nonexistent. While many could argue you just need to move into a city that provides these kinds of transportation it is unrealistic to think that people will do this. In addition to that problem, I also think that we need to change the way we think about cars and how many people think they are “cool”. They are not cool when you know they are deliberately contributing to killing our planet, so if we could get people including myself to change their view on cars it would be very beneficial. But in order to even start this process, I feel as if we need to offer better public transportation.

I think a big part of why people choose not to take buses is because they view the ownership of a car as a symbol of success, or a milestone they have to reach. You graduate college, get your first job, save up enough money to one day buy your own car and house. Then you have your family. If you’re more conscious, you just have one or two children, so you can buy a family car of four. But if you are not, you’ll have to opt in for a minivan, which is much less efficient. Then of course, your spouse must have their own car to transport themselves to work. And then, the average American household owns two cars, while 35% of the U.S. population owns 3 or more. At this point, one is not purchasing cars for the convenience of getting from place to place, that would be where one car suffices, but one is purchasing cars for the status symbol of owning multiple cars. And of course, with many kids and multiple cars, one has to work a full time job which means commuting to and from work. 
<br><br>
I am glad that Ken pointed out the flawed logic of electric cars as environmentally sustainable. It’s true that they are more environmentally friendly than their gasoline powered counterparts, but the production of such cars still emits 2 metric tons of CO2, which according to the Paris Accord, is all that we should be emitting a year. So I guess a person could own an electric car, if they gave up eating, using electricity, and purchasing consumer goods for the entire year. I think the reason people see electric cars, and other “green” products as the solution to our environmental crisis, is because it lets us continue our overly indulgent lifestyles without feeling guilty for the mess we’re leaving on earth. It’s much easier to propose a technological solution than it is to address the issue at its source: American consumerism.

<p>
The fact that Americans work roughly one day a week in order to afford a car is almost as sad as the statistic that Americans spend roughly 100 hours a year driving. My dad had mentioned that statistic one time to me and he followed it with "I wish I got that time back." Given, much of this time is probably spent commuting to a job that he probably really didn't want to go to anyways it's disheartening that that much time is spent doing something that just goes back into making sure that the car is paid for and that he's able to put gas in it for the next day. This is where minimalism could come into play where people who don't enjoy what their doing in their life have the means to change and turn their life into a minimalist one where they don't have to spend so much time doing what the don't want to. Cars will never be environmentally friendly, nor will they ever be a smarter option, as we see with electric cars, but we still buy them, and we pay ridiculous amounts of money and spend an absurd amount of time driving them when we could be doing something else. We buy them for convenience and for the luxury of not having to get onto a crowded bus or a crowded train and try to find an open seat next to some stranger who doesn't look very friendly, but we should do it for the environment and we shouldn't look at the bus or the train as a "cheaper" option and stigmatize it as something that someone rides when they can't afford a car, but as a friendlier option for the environment and your budget.

Being from LA county, I know people love their cars. It’s not only cool, but borderline necessary to commute to a job site in cars since public transportation from cities outside of LA is inefficient and, in parts, dangerous. Changing perception of how we view cars is so vital to mitigating the climate crisis, but I’d argue that government implements can be as helpful as social change. For instance, instead of one carpool lane, how about two? What if every lane except one was carpool, and we actually enforced it? I promise that we’d start to see a switch at minimum towards more people per car, and hopefully an overall switch to more public transportation. The figures about train efficiency are truly mind-boggling, it’s ironic that the “less advanced tech” (trains have been around hundreds of years) is so much better for the environment than even electric cars. It would be a huge boost to local economy to build trains into LA, and traffic would ease up, I don’t really see a downside. 
<br><br>
As soon as American media portrays biking to work as cool, we have a real shot at reducing carbon footprints on a massive scale.
</p><hr>

<p>
Thank you for teaching us why cars are “cool”. It was a substitute industry for war production to keep the economy going. Do we still need them to keep the economy going? How would we phase out cars and make public transportation or more environmentally friendly alternatives economically? It isn’t just making public transportation seem cooler, it’s actually making it cooler. Compared to other countries, our system of public transit sucks. It is slow, and that is why many people opt for cars. Make the roads more conducive for public transportation. Encourage it. Make more buses, or a lane for buses. I don’t have many ideas, but this may be a possible source of jobs for the economy: instead of engineering new technology, engineer infrastructure and policies to encourage public transit.
<br><br>
Reminds me of Walden. The things we equate to “freedom” and “success” are the things holding us back. For “freedom” or convenience, we give up one day of weekend and work instead, and instead of retiring by our late 40s, we retire by 60. I wonder what other tradeoffs we’re making. In exchange for a slower paced life, I could work less and spend less. It makes sense, for instance, instead of paying lots of money for a plane ticket, you could take it slow and do a road trip. Make the journey fun, instead of rushing, stressing, spending more, and using more of your CO2 allotment. I’ll gladly give up a car if it means I can have 4 days work week instead of 5. What does it cost? Just a couple hours, but instead of sitting in my car, I could bike or walk. That’s better for me too. What else can I trade for more happiness and health? Thoreau says a large home, since it causes stress and financial burden. He describes it as a prison rather than a home. A cage, because you’re stuck in it. This appeals to me, because I like the image of freedom. However, some people like having a large home. I think we don’t have to go to the extremes. We just have to reevaluate our actions. They are OUR actions, no one is forcing us to do anything. We chose to follow the system when we are young, and it’s become so ingrained in ourselves and our daily lives that we’ve forgotten that we chose it. We still have a choice to change our paths. It doesn’t have to be a lot. It could just be little, like maybe carpooling.

I agree that, like the video reveals, new technology to fix problems, like electric cars, should not be the main focus when it is clear that public transportation is the solution to limiting carbon emissions. Instead of trying to build the best model of electric car, people should be investing their time into finding out how to implement mass transit throughout the country.
<br><br>
It is so interesting that you were able to compare this with Thoreau's ideas in Walden. Even though Thoreau did not talk about cars, the negative impacts of materialism associated with cars is the same as other items that he had during his lifetime. As new technological innovations become mainstream, the generations that adopt them pass on ideas of how necessary and good the products are, despite them being unnecessary, economically burdensome, and environmentally destructive.

The road to redemption is difficult and the road to damnation isn't. Dramatic- I know but the average Americans carbon output is 20 metric tons. 20. Instead of the 2 metric tons we are supposed to emit. The fact that cars contribute 1/3 of our emissions is believable but insane. Why use cars when we have more environmentally friendly options? well it is out of convenience that we use cars, I live in San Cat and I have no car. Trying to get groceries, or go anywhere far basically I have to wait around for a specific bus that makes 15 minute car rides to 40 minute bus rides. I find myself desperately wanting my car back if and not only to save time but to make my life easier, and yet a part of me knows this is the reason why Americans put out so much carbon emissions. Convenience is everything. Our "best" alternative, electric car, even has problems that do not help the Earth because even creating a car emits 22 metric tons in the first place. 
<br><br>
Social constructs definitely have a strong effect on the consumers opinion. People do not want to give up their convenience and as a country we should understand the impact we all have. Hope breaks down when even our best alternatives are not good enough. This devastation is exhausting but again a Prius hybrid is better than a suv emissions wise. Full change, change capable enough to stop the path we are headed down looks very unlikely. That 2 story house you want with at least 2 luxury cars and other consumer driven dreams do not help our Earth and yet here we are stuck in a loop that society has thrown at us. We all want to say we will change the world but have any of us been putting those words to action. For me, it is reminding myself that I make a difference when I cut down my beef intake and taking the bus because I am not the only person on this planet. Knowledge is power, but power is absent if there is no action.

Before watching this lecture video I knew that cars were bad for our environment but I had no idea they were causing so much more damage than I thought. It is shocking hearing about how much carbon these cars are putting into the air and not only that but how much carbon is put in the air when manufacturing them. It is crazy to think about how a car just sitting in a driveway not being used is releasing 2 metric tons of CO2.
<br><br>
If more people knew about how bad cars are for our environment and decided to switch to using electric cars or even public transportation we would be doing the world a favor by not emitting so much carbon into the atmosphere. Also, if we take into account how expensive these cars are to have possession over, I think people would think twice about wanting to own one. People don’t take in account of how much it is going to cost just to buy the car, but people still have to pay for gas, which is hurting the environment because of the use of fossil fuels, how much money will spend over time fixing the car if a problem occurs, as well as getting your oil changed if you don’t know how to do it yourself, and we can’t forget about getting our tires rotated or even buying new tires if one of them pops.

<p>
Ken’s comment on cars is a huge conundrum for me, being a young male who’s eager to explore the world and try new things, driving is essential to my life, but the carbon budget seems not helping the planet. 
<br><br>

The way I see it, going electric is the trend of the future, or should I say, the future has already come. Not long ago, Ford released its all-electric Mustang Mach E, which is a battery-powered cross over. With such an icon, the holy grail of American muscle cars, you know that a big change of direction for Mustang like this is big, and ford is determined to be a big player in the car market in the next couple of decades. Two days ago, I came across the new EV Hummer. A past died company going back again, with an EV, which is telling something. And let's not forget about Tesla, dominator of the EV market. 
<br><br>

But there’s no way around the carbon budget of manufacturing a car, as Ken said in the video, so realistically, we have only three options. 
<br><br>

One is to buy used cars. As we keep running an old car, its carbon budget for manufacturing evens out year by year.
<br><br>

Two is to buy more efficient cars. We cannot afford big V8s, it is the time for EVs and hybrids. Doing 60 mpg is much better than say 17 mpg V8 Porsche, it also saves you tons of money on fuel.
<br><br>

Three is to simply plant some trees, it sounds stupid, but it works.
<br><br>

Ultimately, having no car in your life is the best choice for our planet, personally, I wouldn’t try that, if you are the same, consider my solutions above.
</p><hr>

<p>
Ken’s lecture was interesting and eye opening. Before watching this lecture I was one of the many people who believed that technological innovations could help the climate crisis. However, after watching this video that provided many statistics to support the argument that the climate crisis is a cultural problem my opinion has changed. One of the many facts that really struck me was “The U.S. has 4% of the world's population and a quarter if its cars.” With that being said, companies are still making more cars that are “low emitters of CO2”  but this is not the solution to the problem. The average car emits 4.6 metric tons of CO2 per year after being manufactured. Our goal of  limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5-2 degrees celsius would require us to emit at most 2 metric tons of CO2 per year.  It takes approximately 2 metric tons of CO2 to manufacture these cars, that’s our emission for the year which does not include food, housing, and clothes.  When cars first became popular americans has two cars which makes me wonder if this number has changed due to how much we glorify and see these vehicles as necessities.
<br><Br>
 Ken mentioned that  it is up to the social sciences to answer the question of why people don’t find public transportation cool in order for us to intervene. I think that social media and the celebrities we look up to play a big role in what we find “cool”. For instance we don’t see celebrities posting pictures of themselves on a subway, riding a bike, or taking the bus to their event, instead they post their customized foreign cars that they spent immense amounts of money on and their private jets. People find this “cool” and aspire to reach this amount of wealth one day. Some people will also find it odd and uncool when celebrities do things to help the environment such as taking a commercial airline instead of a private jet or wearing an outfit twice, calling these celebrities “broke.” Although these are the people who are trying to make a positive change they receive hate for trying to do so.

I felt pretty convicted by the focus on automobiles as a major source of our individual carbon footprints. When I consider all of the lifestyle changes I could make to be more environmentally conscious and reduce my negative impact, giving up my car is by the far the most difficult. Owning a car has become such a significant symbol of the American capitalist lifestyle, and is engrained in our heads as being a necessity in life. More than the symbolic meaning of owning a car, many people actually need to own their own car because the public transportation infrastructure where they live is so inefficient or non-existent. Many others simply want to own their own car so that they can commute on their own terms and in their own spaces. This is characteristic of one of the fundamental principles of Western Capitalist culture - individualism. 
<br><Br>


Electric cars are just another example of fake solutions to environmental problems. The idea of technological solutions to the climate crisis is reflective of our inability to admit that we're wrong and to give up clearly unsustainable behaviors. As Thoreau argued, we come up with more complicated solutions to solve simple problems. We treat symptoms, not causes. I will admit that technocratic solutions will be necessary as we face the effects of climate change, but the belief that these alone will save us is extremely problematic. They reflect our stubborn, arrogant mentality that humans are somehow above nature and can dominate it. Electric cars are just another example of a "solution" for individuals to feel good about themselves while not actually contributing much of anything to the greater good. Just another way to focus on reducing individual footprints while not addressing systemic issues.

<br><Br>

The explosion of the automobile industry shows how most of our ailments as a society, have been driven by top-down initiatives. Our failure as a species has been largely caused by handfuls of people, corporations, and government entities. As much as we can blame the masses of individuals, it is clear that the majority of environmental and social justice issues were perpetuated by an extremely small minority. We didn't collectively decide to drive cars and need to own them. They were sold to us by a powerful automobile industry in collusion with government forces. We don't ask to be flooded with advertising for useless goods and services, but we cannot escape them. We need to stop letting the system blame us individuals for problems that they've forced upon us.

I was rather surprised while watching Professor Ken’s lecture when he spoke about inefficiency (in terms of the lowering the amount of carbon dioxide each individual should admit in their lifetime) electric cars although advertised as environmentally friendly, the fact is quite the opposite because as stated the production of electric cars increase greenhouses gases by 15% to 68%. To address Ken’s question about why people prefer cars over public transportation, I believe the reason is because of self-agency. People are more attracted to the idea of being able to travel from point A to point B without being dependent on a factor such as a bus schedule for example. With an automobile, the person has the freedom to go wherever they plead without being constricted to the bus schedule which depending on if it’s a weekday or the weekend the buses stop running that late at night. However, although people want freedom, populated areas like New York the most efficient way of traveling is the subway. New Yorkers prefer the subway because if you drive or take a taxi it's a given that you are going to be in a traffic jam for half an hour or more. Nonetheless, although this is the case in NY why is this not the case in LA for example. I saw in a Vox youtube video a while back saying how California always has construction on the freeway for two reasons, one being that they are fixing the road and the second one being that they are adding more lanes. The addition of lanes is to diminish the traffic jam however this leads to people who would normally take public transportation perhaps to purchase a car and thus more cars are on the freeway. As a result, there are more cars, more carbon dioxide gases being emitted into the atmosphere which inevitably leads to traffic jams and more harm to the planet.

I 100% agree with you about self-agency. Part of the reasons I want to buy a car here is exactly like what you said--I don't want to depend on anyone to go anywhere whenever I want. But also as you said, this is the case of LA instead of New York, as we don't have efficient public transportation. Though this lack of options for transportation could be dated back to how they planned the city initially, this is a major reason why I don't like about L.A. as I grow up in a city where subways and buses are so accessible. 
<br><Br>

The self-agency might tie to egocentrism that Ken mentioned which is seen a lot in the older generation. People only make decisions and consume for the sake of their own, and are not able to see the consequences -- the sources they've wasted and the damage they've done to the environment. Even though we have the idea of carpooling, many car owners still didn't make an effort to take advantage of that but choose to drive and drive only by themselves. 
<br><Br>

Another potential problem I can think of, which I also included in my previous comments, is that with materialism and how society defines success today, adopting cheaper and fewer things might be indicating degradation of social status. People have a car or want to have one and don't like to take buses and subways is because those are for the poorer. As more people think like that, public transportation is left for the poorer because they don't have a choice. It somehow makes the situation fits the statement even though it's not true. And the buses and subways get dirtier because "who cares", making fewer people want to take them.

No doubt that Americans have a special interest in having cars, but from my perspectives, cars are necessary here. I mean, if all the public transportation besides highways extends to the suburbs, I would be delighted to take buses and subways. However, the problem is, since most of the people in the US still live in towns surrounding big cities, there is actually no convenient way to get to where you want. Forget about the railway, we all know it is unrealistic to carry so much and it is nowhere cheap. Now we are talking about getting rid of private cars, but first I think we need more infrastructure centralizing the idea of public transportation. Because of the car culture in this nation, the government has for a long time considering building more roads for cars instead of taking care of the transportation system. Just take a look at the New York garbage-like subway system, it is quite clear that the government never pays much attention. Therefore, we don’t even have a choice but to have a car and drive it with only one man. Although in the lecture the professor says it took only 4 gallon per human to travel from New York to LA, but have you taken into account the value of time? You may have to wait for hours just to fetch a bus that never comes (actually I met with such conditions many times). Therefore, it is not effective by simply educating people when it comes to driving cars. For me, all that can be effective is to persuade people to buy electric cars and hope for the best.

I agree with what you are talking about. Cars are more likely a necessity for us to live in the U.S. I admit that public transportations are more environment-friendly and can reduce our carbon footprint, but they just make our life so hard and less convenient. For example, I probably got to wait for 20 minutes or so if I want to go to the marketplace or somewhere which is not in a walkable distance. The bus schedule here is not that clear and buses are not usually: on time: it could be early or late. I'm annoyed by this because it really ruined my schedule several times. For this reason, I would say if the government wants to encourage people to drive their cars less frequently, they should first make their public transportations more organized and convenient.

I would have to agree with you that currently, in the majority of the U.S., public transportation does not seem to be a feasible option for much of the population. A car really is more convenient and reliable for day to day events because U.S. infrastructure has been built in favor of a heavily car-dependent culture and, aside from major cities, public transportation services are lacking. However, I would say that, even though electric cars are better than a regular car, I would rather try to suggest for others to ditch a car in general than convince them to choose to drive an electric car, which still has a significant carbon footprint. There needs to be a cultural shift to advocate for mass public transportation so that, hopefully, the government will implement policies for an effective and efficient public transportation system

I really enjoy how Ken debunks the idea that buying electric cars will not really solve the problem that our climate is currently facing. Yes, if you need to buy a car, then electric is definitely the route to go if you want to be the most conscious about the environment. But when people are looking for a car while they are considering how they can best support the climate change movement, many forget that there are factories and manufacturers that are creating the parts for the car and the car itself. The process of making the car is causing the CO2 emissions to go up, and if one thinks that they are doing the best thing for the environment by buying an electric car, then they are incorrect. 

<br><Br>

There is a cool and convenient factor to owning a car, and I enjoy how Ken attributes the reasoning for buying a car towards the work of social scientists who can analyze and explain this behavior. Cars are cool and more people want to be cool, so yes, more people will buy cars. The cool cars are often not the energy-efficient ones, so the more CO2 is going to be produced when people buy cars. And people will always pay extra money for convenience. If they want to leave when they want to, then owning a car will always be the viable option. However, in order to combat the climate, we have to stop worrying about what our society thinks of us and start caring more about the survival of the society in general. The fact that only 5% of the workforce uses a car to get to work is utterly ridiculous, considering the amount of workplaces in an urban environment where the amount of bus stops is plentiful. Yet, because people feel more secure and have an aspect of “this is mine” when it comes to owning a car, cars are more often bought than taking the bus, even if it is the more expensive option. 

<br><Br>

However, I think that Ken fails to bring up one point that is essential to the purchasing of a car: timing. For example, currently, there are students at UCSB who are contemplating getting a job off-campus at downtown. However, without a car, the drive to downtown takes around an hour, which is accounting the bus stops, the slower movement of buses, etc. Yet, with a car, it may take less than 30 minutes to get to downtown. Now, how does that work exactly? How can people think about getting to a job that they need to if the time constraints don’t allow for it? Well, that is one thing that public transportation needs to consider. The speed in which transits move is a big issue when it comes to people within the workforce, and in order to combat that, speed and availability are two things that one must consider. 

<br><Br>

With all of that said, I think the biggest issue that continues to affect climate change is laziness. We are considerably lazy in what we do, and because of it, we are not willing to take public transit, but instead, take cars - even if they are more expensive. However, we must understand what this does to our planet and continue to take the necessary steps in order to prevent it.

In the lecture, "Why the Climate Crisis is a Cultural Problem" and the problems of electric cars, it was truly eye-opening to the fact that this idea of technological advancement that we so solemnly  glorify isn't the solution to our modern climate issues. The real solution has been right in front of our eyes, we mist completely cut out the usage of motored vehicles, because one way or another they are still damaging this planet, whether it's through th burning of fossil fuels through the vehicle, or the mass production of them and how overall, we need to completely cut everything off involved with vehicles, because even if you don't drive it, the sole production of that vehicle has already done so much damage. The future has not cars, and that's the reality. There are so many factors that people don't account for when thinking of emissions, and those are the real killers. It's just mind-bogging and how we have linked this glorified sense of ownership of vehicles with success and personal comfort, at the expense of our planet, the sole piece of space rock that keeps us alive. I do seem to see realize that there are many downsides to this idea of completely cutting off vehicle usage, but the return is much greater than any sort of advantage or simplification of life it could possibly grant us. It's pretty crazy how just the sole production of a vehicle has the equivalence of two metric tons of CO2, meaning that we are doubling our carbon footprint by simply buying a car. 
<br><br>
This way of living must be stopped, this idea of free mobilization, might be able to provide us with comfort and put us at ease in many ways, but the cost is way too high. The possible results outweigh the inconveniences that come along with it. The future doesn't have cars.

Very interesting take, Jason. While I feel that this type of response is expected from Professor Hiltner, we must ask ourselves: How is "completely cutting out the usage of motored vehicles" going to be feasible? Yes, I agree that it is a culture thing, but how can we change an aspect of our culture that is so ingrained? We have so much infrastructure related to automobiles that it is very hard to see a future where there are no cars. While I agree with you in that the benefits could outweigh the drawbacks, I think that viewing a future without any cars is something that is, as of now, very far fetched.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your statement that we need to cut out the use of motorized vehicles or and type of mass produced manufactured methods of transportation. The fact that 22 tons of Carbon Dioxide are emitted on average when producing a motor vehicle is absolutely mind boggling, considering that this is merely the production phase and is not including any numbers concerning the actual emissions of the car post-purchase. I understand that in certain areas, having a car is a necessity in order to survive in this day and age and for that reason, I am fine with and actually encourage the purchase of a zero emission vehicle as it cuts average emissions of a gas powered car in half. However, as Ken stated in the video, if you want to have a healthy environment, you should not exceed the two ton limit of Carbon Dioxide production per year. If you consider that every year for 11 years you have already emitted 2 tons of Carbon Dioxide just from the manufacturing of your car, it is atrocious to think how much people are personally emitting over that level. If you have the circumstances to cut out a car completely from your life, I highly encourage it and am able to see that you do too through your original response. What I do think you should have touched on, however, was the transition from personal to public transport for those who needs motorized transportation for their lives. The switch from car to bus has the ability to reduce an individuals carbon footprint by a factor of 14. Still, however, the use, or at least the mass production of automobiles needs to be contained while we still have a chance. Its unfathomable to believe the US has more cars than licensed drivers, but instead of just talking about it over the internet, we need to be the ones implementing the change.


<br><hr>
I agree that cars are not the future. At least, cars are not a part of any future I would want to live in. Transitioning from a society with such a heavy reliance on personal vehicles to one that relies on public transportation is without a doubt a necessity. It will definitely be difficult at first. Many places do not have reliable public transportation, especially rural areas where everything is spread so far from everything else. However, once local governments see that it is a major concern for its citizens, that is where the attention will rightfully turn to. It will be a major cultural shift, but I think it will be good for us. We are so used to having everything on demand; we order something online and receive it the very next day, we want to go to the store and we arrive in our car minutes later. The simple act of waiting for public transportation is a grounding experience (speaking as someone who waited for the city bus every day of my high school career). Personally I think that the inconvenience of waiting for the bus is worth not having to pay for gas every week and stress about the check-engine light. And for those of us who need immediate transportation, there are many ride sharing services that I don't see going out of style anytime soon, especially as they can be easily adapted to fit our increasingly eco-friendly society.
<br><br>
Before this video, I had no idea that so much of a car's emissions come from its very production. It really drives home the fact that even for a "zero-emission" car, it still has an impact on the environment. There is also the problem with how we deal with efficient products. When we have more efficient cars, we do not simply emit less; in fact, we often just use them more. We have a habit of viewing efficiency as a justification for higher usage than being happy that we are leading cleaner lives.
<br><Hr>
    Although I agree that not driving cars could be the solution to climate change issues, it is just not the reality. Cars will not go away, in fact many people look to cars as the future, with being even faster or even having flying cars. Although this way of living, as you put it, “must be stopped” it won’t be because I doubt that people will give up cars. Many people view public transportation as dirty or dangerous and would not take them to travel long distances. Not only that, but other modes of transportation, such as biking or walking, especially for people who are younger and female could be dangerous. I know for myself anyway that there are many places that I would be afraid to go at night, even Uber drivers can be frightening. So while I agree that the solution does mean to decrease carbon emissions by getting rid of cars, I just don’t see this being a reality anytime soon. I disagree with your statement “ The future has no cars, and that's the reality” because I don;t think that this is the reality, but I think that it is ideal. Americans like their cars too much and public transportation isn’t advanced or reliable enough for everyone to ditch their cars just yet. Although I understand that most places do have access to other modes of transportation besides cars, it’s just not always the case. For example, my cousins who live in the country cannot use buses to go to the city because there are no bus stops where they live. So while I do agree that it is ideal for people to ditch their cars, it just isn’t realistic quite yet.

As a statistics major, I was really interested in the stats Ken gave during this lecture. I found it really interesting that a typical car emits about 4.6 metric tons of CO2 per year, which is more than two times as more of what we want one human to emit per year, as said by the Paris Accord. Before this lecture, I thought electric cars were a good step towards facing climate change, however I did not account for the amount of CO2 that would be emitted from the production of an electric car. The best way to combat climate change is not to build more technological inventions, but rather to change our culture.
<br><br>
In our materialistic society, we define success with materialistic items, like having expensive cars. Even though public transportation is a more environmental friendly way of transportation, we as a society look down upon it, which is why we see even environmental activists like Elon Musk work on a way to improve cars, instead of advocating for public transportation. In order to truly make a change, we must get rid of the materialistic mindset, rather than trying to invent new technological items and further feeding into the consumerism market.

Really agree with you.It is said that low-carbon lifestyle is the antidote to the earth's fever. However, in reality, people's change from high-carbon lifestyle to low-carbon lifestyle is slow, and the misconception that hinders people's behavior lag is mainly manifested in the following aspects: coping with climate change is the business of the government and scientists, which has nothing to do with themselves; high-quality life should be satisfied through excessive consumption; low-carbon life is poverty, which means living a life of asceticism We need to go back to the era of low material production capacity and so on. However, this high growth, high consumption development model has spread to developing countries in the past few hundred years. At present, some developed countries are strongly opposed to changing the consumption and production systems that cause climate problems, while some elites in developing countries are unwilling to change the model they learn from developed countries, which causes the bottleneck in the process of global response and adaptation to climate change.
<br><Hr>
I agree with you on the idea that, " the best way to combat climate change... [is] to change our culture." This is a really exciting and interesting idea, and I believe that Professor Hiltner has been hinting at this through suggestions of specific culture changes over the course of his online lectures. I believe that our only hope at achieving a sustainable way of life has to come from a revolution from the people in the way that we view nonrenewable materials. Unfortunately, this is much easier said than done. I doubt that a change of this magnitude is possible in the near future, but it may be our only chance.
<br><Br>
 I personally am swayed by the American custom of automobile ownership, as I find it difficult to imagine living without a car. I feel that I use a car almost every day when I am home from college in ways that I couldn't via public transportation. As an avid mountain biker and surfer, I spend a large amount of time driving to distant, remote locations with boards or bikes, and other equipment that would be very difficult to get on a bus. Additionally, most of the places I visit for recreation aren't accessible through bus routes, never mind train and subway. I believe that the pressure shouldn't currently be on individuals to change, but rather our public transportation systems to improve first. It is still extremely inconvenient to travel on public transportation in many areas not in the heart of a city, and in the country may outright be impossible.
<br><hr>
I agree with you comment. I had no clue that electrical cars are actually bad for the environment! That is insane. In my mind I though that Elon Musk was a genius and someone who was going to change the world. Now I realize that its a facade and that it is just another way for us to chase a materialistic lifestyle without having to feel bad about polluting the Earth.

<br><hr>
I agree with Ken when he says that the only way we can combat climate change is to change our culture and overall outlook on material possessions.  Although this sounds like a great solution, I think it's easier said than done.  To alter a culture, it would take an insane amount of persuasion and alterations to our everyday lives.  Although this is not impossible,  I think only time will tell when these changes will happen.  Even though the future of cars is unpredictable, I think there will be a growing trend to using more public transportation as innovations and accommodations to public transit becomes more advanced.  In this particular case, the growth of technology is not a bad thing but instead is benefitting the population at large.  This is why I slightly disagree with the comment that building technological inventions will not combat climate change at all as there is the possibility that it will benefit mass transit and thus the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
Before this class, never knew that public transportation was better for the environment. It obviously makes sense though because buses and things like that hold so much more people in a vehicle that doesn't emit gas by the same factor that a sum of single cars for each person would. I just never thought about it. Although I think we should push toward a society where we think of public transportation as more cool, I think it would be very very difficult to get everyone on board. This is especially because you can go to pretty much any location you want in a car whereas traveling by bus, there is only a certain amount of bus stops, and in many cases one would have to walk the rest of the way to their destination, especially if they're not in a big city. It's doable of course, but it's also hard to think that most Americans wouldn't be so lazy if they had enough money to buy a car.
<br><br>
  Also, with concern to technology helping us solve the climate change issue, there is other technology that would help a great deal if actually developed. Technology such as this would include some way to actually physically reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere with machines of some sort.
<br><hr>
In this same sense we face the ironic threat of dealing with the rapidly advancing developing countries that are striving to lead lifestyles like our own. We as a culture have to make a shift to a low materialistic society and have to mitigate a near opposite ride in the development and growth of materialism. We've built and maintained a life that other people now want to live and it's now our turn to lead the way to a better more efficient lifestyle. A promise of large-scale societal change would poll well and would likely yield high public approval, as people are aging and things like the internet move information much faster it will appeal to a much larger group of people worldwide. The trick would be recreating a universal society, one contingent on cooperation rather than domination. Its a harrowing idea but just as exciting.
<br><hr>
I agree with you that the only way to combat climate change is by shifting our mindset away from materialistic objects. In America, a large part of one’s success is measured by the car they drive, but simply having a car far exceeds the amount of CO2 that is acceptable for one person to emit in a year.  The future of the planet is dependent not on technological advances but on our materialistic culture. We need to make public transportation socially acceptable for the sake of the planet as shifting to electric cars is not enough. We need to abandon cars as a whole; however, the freedom that comes with a car makes it difficult to imagine doing so. If efforts were to be directed towards improving public transportation systems, I believe more people would be willing to give up their personal cars.



<br><hr>
The reason why new energy vehicles will be given a green light is because it plays an important role in energy saving and emission reduction. Especially at the moment when environmental pollution is severely overwhelmed, for long-term development, energy saving and emission reduction are imperative. However, electric vehicles are frequently detained as "dirty electricity". Just because China's current electricity consumption is mainly coal-fired, many people think that this source of electricity is upside down, and finally the environmental pollution is higher than fuel vehicles.

In the lecture video, Professor Hiltner has really provided a different angle to view the climate crisis. I have to admit that before watching the video, I always believe that the technology advancement, which include the electric cars, would be the best and the most effective way to mitigate the climate crisis. However, when I am watching the video, I have realized that the manufacture of electric cars also emits plenty of carbon footprints, and the cultural changes are more important. As Professor Hiltner has said in the video, cars are not as cool as how they are sound like. Instead of driving a car, even an electric car, taking public transportation or riding a bike is much more environment-friendly.

I am really glad that you did not idolize Elon Musk as many environmentalists mistakenly do. The statistic that even if we were to buy a 0 emissions car, we would have gone over the number of metric tons that we are supposed to is an important thing to consider. If Elon Musk cared more about the environment than he did for corporate interest, then we would advocate for public transportation. On the contrary, he believes in the private funding of roads and cars, as he said so himself that he believes that capitalism is essential for the advancement of technology. And once again as you said, social science is needs to take up a large role in science and technology in limiting anthropogenic climate. Therefore, climate change is inherently political, as it is human created, created by the politics that have enabled such change. In addition, this is evidenced during the manufacturing boom during WW2, when greater funding went into roads than investment in public transit. I agree on how this ‘culture’ of thinking cars is cool is something that popped up without explanation, but rather the material conditions caused by capitalism and the automobile industry. It is obvious that the investment into the industry was prioritized, as ⅙ of Americans were employed by the automobile industry in the 1950s. 
<br><br>
So yes I agree that the climate crisis is a cultural problem, but it did not arise due to the selfish and consumptive inherent nature of the human, but rather the established capitalist conditions which prioritized the automobile over public transportation. This is seen in other wasteful habits, such as unsustainable packaging in products, which regular people have really no say in as they don’t on the prioritization of transportation. The capitalist conditions and its effect on the environment is evident throughout everything we have learned in class, and in regards to the car, we see it in the amount of money that cars cost Americans. Though public transportation is cheaper than private vehicles, we still see Americans purchasing vehicles. I think it was astonishing to hear that on average, 1 out of the 7 work days are spent working for a car. I do not think it has more to do with the culture than the fact that some people really need their cars to commute to work, to survive, rather than just for fun, especially for those who are not rich or well off.

It's crazy because everyone makes electric cars seem like the right answer to replacing gas cars. I was surprised to read the title "why electric cars are more trouble than good." I was even more shocked about the positive outcomes of not owning a car, from having a 3 day weekend to saving up to 9,000 a year. Living in Santa Barbara reminds me how easy and effective riding the bus is. The only downside is that it is not always reliable on timing but it works pretty well. I also agree with how this culture sees cars as cool because I used to think the same until right now. I guess I never saw the gravity of trouble cars bring to the climate crisis. The way cars are talked about and depicted as giving you freedom is a really compelling advertisement, especially to the youth. I wonder if they knew how much money they would waste on cars if they would still love them as much. I agree with the comment you made about the fact that some people depend on their car to survive and earn a living. It sucks how that is an important point that sometimes cars make some people’s lives better, like the poor, but how simultaneously, how it is making them lose money.
<br><Hr>
Hello, thank you for your reply! I also agree that we often think that electric cars seem like the most viable solution for transportation in regards to the climate crisis. Maybe it might be the industry/corporations? After all, the professor mentioned that the automobile industry boomed during the 2nd World War. Investments in roads for cars have thus increased as a result of it, instead of public transportation. So maybe it’s more economically profitable for corporations to invest in electric cars than public transportation, and maybe an industry in electric cars is simply profitable enough. I think that public transportation is a bit of a struggle, but I think that it may be more accessible if there were  more investment in it. For example, there is so much investment in private roads, as mentioned, when contrasted with public transportation. 
<br><br>
It is also strange again to see how our culture believes that cars are “cool,” and how that idea of a car being “cool” is simply shaped by our conditions, such strong reliance on the car. I also think that it is sad how we have been fed the idea that driving a car is liberating, when in reality it’s quite the opposite. The idea of ownership of something is seen as liberating in a capitalist culture, but in reality, it can tie us down to debt. Owning a car seems “cool” because we have an “ownership” of something, but in reality, we really don’t, as it is such a large expense for us, and as the professor mentioned, 1 out of the 7 working days we spend go towards working for a car. I also agree that it is unfortunate that a capitalist society has made its very products a necessity for us to survive, in this case cars. Many people unfortunately need cars, even poor people, and it is difficult for them to go without if they have to commute far for work. In addition, they may not even be able to pay for electric cars, so it seems to me that truly the electric cars are made for those who can afford it, whereas in contrast, public transportation would be financially accessible to many people.

What is so astonishing to me till this very day, is the fact that we all carry a carbon footprint and many of us don't even realize that at all with in the entirety of our own lives. Ken's video here describing how the climate crisis itself is in part a cultural problem is because here in the United States and many other cultures around the world are based around this materialistic culture where the people buy, buy and buy to fill in the endless void of desire.We're exposed a lot to advertisements on the daily from the television to our phones, they make there presence showing us as what they promise as ways to make our lives a lot more better than they are and people fall into this belief. The fashion industry is such of these voids, where "fast fashion" poisons people into falsely following these fashion trends which makes them buy what "new" without understanding the deeper consequences that lie right behind their the clothing that lays upon their skin as the film "True Cost" highlights such consequences on the lives of developing nations. 
<br><br>
Anyway, the United State's culture alone is already problematic for the car scene alone, where a major car culture has evolved over the life time of the automobile industry's lifetime Ever year car industries come out with new models that are supposedly better than the originals, which isn't permanently the case where newer cars are the original internals with a new body, and trick many people into believing that they need them, which results in people buying new cars beyond there given life time. They fall into this void of endless need and desire that was created by our world's culture of endless goods and we all have with many other materials we came to be with.
<br><br>
But, that's what is shocking, we fall into this trick into believing that material goods will satisfy us and instead fall waste, ever so expanding our carbon footprint. The creation of a car and buying a new car already sets you up with a 2 metric ton carbon footprint which is mind boggling. Just think about all the other goods that we surround our very life with and the amount of carbon that builds up into our carbon footprint, it would be immense. I completely agree with Ken here, the climate crisis in itself buries itself deep inside our cultural roots of capitalism and will be something that will take a whole lot of momentum to undo.

I find it quite astonishing as well once Professor Ken told us how even if we buy a low emissions vehicle and never use it, the carbon emissions used to make the vehicle is more that we should use in our life time if we want to reduce carbon emissions. Also your comments on "materialistic culture" are pretty accurate. I know a lot of people who want a Tesla because its the "future of eco friendly cars" but its more along the lines of having it as a status symbol. If someone really wanted to be eco friendly, they'd use public transportation or ride their bike to work. People are seeking to do these eco friendly endeavors for the wrong reasons. I think the same goes with the attempt to find or make a reduced emission vehicle as a means of reducing carbon emissions. Wouldn't it be better to not use a vehicle at all? I feel like people think these car manufacturers are a means to an end when in reality, there just avoiding the problem of carbon emission in a disguised type of way. I think this is what Ken refers to as viewing the climate situation as a technological problem and not a cultural one. We need to get rid of the idea that there will be a piece of technology that can solve our problems because a lot of the issues with climate change right now, such its denial or the means or reducing carbon footprint through "Eco" consumer goods, is embedded in our culture. Even though trains and buses have a carbon footprint, public transportation is very effective. We're sharing this footprint together so its carbon footprint is a marginal amount to that of a car. Places like Japan have such a good public transportation system, that i sometimes wonder what would happen if the automobile industry changed into public transportation one.

<br><Hr>
In my sophomore year of high school, there was a trend going around to take a carbon footprint calculator. Of course I wanted to be a part of it so I took it thinking I would have comparable scores to my friends. After I got my results I saw I had a very high score and I was genuinely embarrassed. After that I swore to do what I could, within reason, to reduce my carbon footprint. I had been so blissfully unaware of my effect on the planet and even now I probably don't know all the ways that my impact is detrimental to the environment. I am guilty of eating meat, driving around aimlessly, and buying fast fashion. But I have since then tried to carpool, eat way less meat, and stop buying as much clothing. I think the most important thing we can do is educate others, especially the youth, on climate change, alternatives, and their impacts. This is a scientific and humanities issue.

<br><hr>
I always that this skewed image in my head that I know that Ken keeps telling us to forfeit the use of cars and start to walk, use the train, bus as a form of extreme thinking, because of course I could just use an electric car and I wouldn't be expelling any CO2 into the atmosphere, right! right?... wrong. It was mind-boggling to me that the production of electric cars produces between 15-68% more greenhouse gases than a gasoline car. I'm not gonna lie, when I first heard this I almost felt discouraged like well there goes my future plan to be more economically sustainable. But then I really changed the narrative in my head that no, living here in SB, I really appreciate that life without a car has not only been in a way freeing I no longer have to look for parking everywhere I go, and I don't have to worry about when my car's next service appointment is etc etc. But it has also been a way to exercise, in the mornings, at night, during the day when I know I would've been too lazy to do so if I did not have a car. It also allowed me to meet and get to know so many different people when I was taking the bus to downtown SB and my previous idea of public transportation, that it was unsafe and scary, was a complete and utter fabrication of the truth. 
<br><br>
Also as you stated that if you keep a car for 11 years and do not drive it one day then you still would've maxed out your carbon footprint for the year. Therefore, If we are trying to adhere to the Paris agreement to save the planet, and you still decide to buy a car then you will essentially have to forego all the other benefits you would like, like eating meat, buying new clothing and many other polluting activities. Moreover, from a financial standpoint, one would be able to save so much money if we do not buy a car. The average cost of a car is $9,000 a year. Therefore, the average American works one day a week just to afford a car. Imagine the opportunity cost of not buying a car, It would be huge! We could do so much with that $9,000 while simultaneously saving the environment. You could retire in your late 40s if you didn't buy a car! The problem with the automobile industry now as well is that it has not only become a means of transport, It's also become another way in which consumers are able to flaunt their wealth to others by purchasing more than one, two, three cars or the most expensive brands, even if they don't have the financial ability to do so!!

I recognize that the automobile industry is a significant issue that must be addressed, but I am not optimistic in regards to seeing people move away from such car culture in terms of the necessity it has in the daily lives of people. While our carbon footprint associated with vehicles is very high, I don’t believe that it may be possible to transition from its usage as I believe many people rely on it for convenience and for living purposes. Ultimately, I believe it would be too difficult for people to adjust to such a major change at least from where I come from as everyone uses a car and not as many people use public transport. They would have to voluntarily give up their usage of cars that they have available to use public transport.
<br><br>
I thought it was important for Ken to bring up the reality of electric cars as he shed light on how its manufacturing would produce even more greenhouse gas emissions than those of a gasoline car. Rather than just thinking of it to be more environmentally friendly, we need to recognize the consequence of its production with factories. As cars have tremendously grown to become a necessity in the lives of people around the world, I believe it would be impossible to move away from it.
<br><br>
I believe technological innovation is necessary to ultimately better our environmental conditions but will have to change our lifestyles. Doing this would require everyone to be on the same page of seeing the bigger picture yet again I am doubtful of that. If there was a way of making electric cars affordable to the mass while being produced without being environmentally harmful with the greenhouse gas emissions or at reducing it much lower than those of the production of gasoline cars, it wouldn’t affect people’s lives as much. They would instead be driving cars that wouldn’t be emitting greenhouse gases. One way or another change is necessary, and the greatest factor to produce such change is a unified acknowledgement and action towards it.

I agree that the culture in the US would be very resistant to giving up cars. I also agree that cars have grown to become a necessity around the world. When I was in high school, I had to travel all over Northern California for soccer games. Doing away with cars would mean that many things like travel sports or hobbies would have to be stopped or would become very impractical. America would never want to step away from this freedom. That is why I also agree that maybe instead of getting rid of cars as a whole we should take a look at manufacturing processes and reduce emission in that area. If we can make electric cars that do not emit any carbon dioxide then we should be able to make them without emitting green house gasses. In fact, manufacturing as a whole could be overhauled to reduce emissions. In this way, the American culture could remain largely unchanged, but at the same time reduce the carbon footprint. I just feel that the way of life that so many Americans have grown to enjoy would take longer to change than manufacturing or ways of producing.

I agree with your sentiment. Although I am hopeful that people will abandon their desires to consume and be apart of the car culture we have in our society, this would require a break in the cultural mindsets we have and massive restructuring of our society in terms of public transportation. Even when we evaluate the facts regarding the amount of emissions made by producing and using cars, it is highly unlikely that we will change. It is not like the average citizen would stop using their car just after hearing these shocking facts. People rely on their cars for their work and family and also see it as one of their assets where a portion of their money remains. In order for this to happen, there would need to be massive improvements to every public transportation system, everywhere. People would have to be educated about the benefits of reducing their carbon footprints and incentivized to use public services. However, this would require a large amount of government intervention and money. And, at the time being, a large amount of constituents aren't willing to give that power to the government and politicians aren't willing to spend government money on climate-change driven agendas.
<br><br>
       Additionally, I agree with your evaluation of how we need to evaluate our actions and their true consequences. Many people are unaware of the impacts of producing and disposing of electric car batteries. However, I disagree with your evaluation regarding innovation. Last quarter in ES 1 (highly recommended by the way!), I learned about the Jevons Paradox. It essentially states that as we innovate to improve the efficiency of a product, consumption for that product increases due to rising demand. Although it would be great to just make the production of electric cars more efficient and mass produce them to reduce the amount of gas cars, we need to evaluate what the true environmental impact will be, and compare it to the real possibility of changing our public transportation system. However, I agree that change is necessary, now, and everywhere.

I found Ken’s notion of the freedom provided by a car is offset by a day’s work interesting and thought-provoking, as this idea has really changed my opinion on cars. Previously, I thought that one day when I earn more money, I would like to buy a “cool” car like Tesla, but after being aware of the significant difference between driving a car and public transit, I start to reflect on my goal on car. This also provoked me to reflect on what is true “freedom” and the effect of media and advertisement on our belief and behaviors. The fancy scenes depicted in some TV shows and advertisements about owning a car makes people feel that car is almost necessary to live an ideal life, but if we rationally think about the financial burden it adds to our life, the opportunity cost of owning and maintaining a car might exceed the pleasure and utility it brings to us. 
 <br><br>

I have been a promoter of public transit since my I was a teenager. Even I was not distinctly clear about the carbon footprints of cars and the significant environmental advantage of public transit, I just knew, based on my common sense, that public transit is more efficient economically and environmentally, as one more person on a subway doesn’t really add to more emission, but one person driving her/his car is obviously generating extra emission. The benefits of public transit are apparent, and I also believe that to make public transit more appealing to the general public, it can improve its efficiency by, for example, being more on time, as it can be really annoying if workers and students who prioritize punctuality cannot get on buses on time, and several times of experiencing late buses can directly stop them from taking busses but switching to private cars.
 <br><br>

This lecture of Ken also enlightens me on the cultural aspect of the problem of climate change by going deeply into the specific issue of transportation, which allows me to vividly see how cultural and historical aspects play important roles in climate change. Ken said, “approaching this as a human issue can and should be empowering”, which I found encouraging and helpful for me to realize the importance of cultural solution to climate change. For example, in many cultures, having a decent car is a symbol of success, and this cultural trend is really making a difference to our climate, but some cultural solutions such more advertisements or lead actions of celebrities to promote public transits can be effective to change this trend and reduce carbon footprints caused by transportation. Finally, I believe that a combination of technological efficiency and cultural promotions would be the most ideal and effective way to mitigate climate change, as that way people are more likely to switch their lifestyle and that switch will be appealing and efficient instead of costly, making the change long-lasting and enjoyable.

I was very intrigued by the opinions and solutions you provided within your statement. Sadly, I can relate to the students you spoke of that began to favor private transportation over public. Of course I have had encounters with late trains and buses but this was not necessarily enough to put me off of them forever. Instead, I found my problem to more along the lines of safety. I have had many uncomfortable interactions while on public transit that have made me nearly swear off ever using one again. I believe that there are also many others like me who have had similar experiences. 
<br><br> 
While having public transportation running on time is a very important factor in swaying the public back to this mode of transit, I would like to add upon that statement by suggesting increased security as well. I would definitely go back to taking trains if I felt that the stations had been revamped in a way that increased my safety. This is also how many others would likely react to the correct changes being made. However, in that sense, I do not agree that the opportunity cost of owning a car exceeds its utility because until these changes are made, I will still continue to worry about my personal safety first.
<br><Hr>
I agree with your point about security, which is something I overlooked. Security is definitely the most important factor to consider for transportation, and certainly public transits' security can be improved to make them more welcome to the public. My point about punctuality is mainly based on my personal experience, and I am more than willing to hear more suggestions on improving the general public's acceptance for public transits.
<br><br>
Regarding the point on opportunity cost of owning a car, this may vary from person to person based on different individual's financial circumstances or personal situations, but I think that at least for some cases, the opportunity cost of owning a car is huge due to the price, maintenance costs, and the time cost of driving a car (which you don't need to sacrifice when, for example, taking subway).
    <br><hr>
    Much like you, I was also intrigued about how big of a cultural problem the climate crisis really is. Like Ken said, the only reason why many of us drive and own multiple cars is that it makes us look “cool”. I think the reason why the climate crisis is very complex because it has been ingrained in many cultures to adopt practices that are detrimental to the environment. Like you mentioned, public transit has a long way to go in many places for it to actually seem more desirable than driving your own car. To do this means to spend money on improvements which will unfortunately eventually become a political issue. Until America steps up to the plate to make a cultural change for this issue I believe most of the rest of the world will stay dormant on this issue.
<br><br>
 Your comment on media’s influence was very interesting because I never really blamed media for mercilessly painting pictures in consumers' heads saying that they need the newest most expensive version of something you already own and makes you feel bad if you don’t buy it. I hope that soon people will realize the true cost of just even owning a car and how by owning it you will have already reached the maximum amount of emission a person should emit in their lifetime.
<br><hr>

despite my many bad experiences in the past with public transportation I still find the idea to be one of the best ways to cut down the amount of pollution being put into the atmosphere. However, with the current system as it is, I still find myself hesitant to actually use it. You make a good argument about the drawbacks to owning a car, but I feel that in its current state, public transportation is still not developed enough to use as society’s main source of mobility. 
<br><br>
Contributing once again to our discussion of the problems with public transportation, sanitary transit is hard to come by. This issue may be the hardest to tackle because it is seemingly unavoidable. Many people, both sick and healthy, ride on public transportation hourly, which only works to spread infection to others. In this way, owning a car has an added health benefit that, coupled with safety and reliability, works to sway me towards the side of car use instead of public transportation. 
<br><br>
I also acknowledge that all of the benefits I am receiving are those of convenience. My stance is probably quite typical of one who has bought into the ease that consumerism offers, but it is really hard to give up something when the other available options are not compatible with my priorities. I hope in the future cities world-wide can adopt some of the changes we both mentioned. If that were to ever come about I would likely rethink my own situation and switch over to using public transportation once again.

Alright Ken, you got me with this video.
<br><br>
Right off the bat, I was a little taken aback by Ken's attack on both electric cars. I think in hindsight, obviously its easy to see what we should have done when it comes to how we approached addressing the car problem in the US. It's insane that just manufacturing a car is contributing over 2 metric tons of CO2 to the atmosphere. This doesn't mean that the development and popularity of  "zero emission" cars isn't a step in the right direction! It's much better than driving a gas guzzling SUV everyday. Like yea, while the problem of HOW we manufacture these cars is something that should be understood, I think it's great that Americans have a way to ease into a more eco-friendly lifestyle and make it more cool to care about the environment.
<br><br>
That aside, Ken's point about the American problem of mass use of automobiles is valid; we should have more of a social focus rather than technological. I just feel like it's a much deeper and daunting problem to address socially in the sense that automobile innovation is such an ingrained part US history and culture. I remember in school learning in admiration about Henry Ford and his contributions to American industrialism through the automobile industry. All day long we are bombarded with ads for cars. TV shows and movies glamorize the simple idea of zooming fast in the newest car with big explosions in the background telling you "BUY ME YOU WILL BE COOL!" All that aside, the freedom and ease just owning your own car provides you with an invaluable resource: extra time in your day to day life (countering Ken's "retiring at the age 40" point). To me all this just seems way harder than changing just cracking open a can of beans or reducing the amount of items you own. 
<br><br>
I know this is really cynical and depressing of me to say all these things, but this is how i'm looking at it realistically, and I'm a dude who's generally interested now (more than ever) to help fight climate change. Do I think I could walk more and actively look for areas in my life I can reduce the use of cars via public transportation/carpooling/biking?  Hell yea! Do I think I could support popularizing buses and trains as well as zero emission manufacture of cars? I'd go for it. Do I think I could give up use of a car entirely and not buy one? Unfortunately with my current mindset, probably not yet.

I was also very shocked about the point about electric cars. They are advertised to be beneficial to the environment, but in reality they do more damage than good.
<br><hr>

Before watching this video I was pretty sold on Teslas being the future. With Elon Musk saying that he would work until all cars on the road were electric, and the whole electric car movement I was sure that they were the most climate-friendly vehicle. BUT to release 2 metric tons just to MANUFACTURE one of these vehicles is insane. 
<br><Br>
  I don't know how we as a society will cut out cars from the lifestyle, as many Americans commute to work/wherever they need to go and love the freedom they get with a car. Maybe E-bikes will be a better alternative. But one thing is for certain, there are lots of buses and trains with empty seats that are out and about daily. If we make the change the social stigma of public transit then we will be making a huge step in the right direction.

This lecture challenged my previous knowledge about electric cars. Initially, I thought electric cars should be widely promoted because it will release less amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which would then help to mitigate the climate crisis. However, it seems to me now electric cars wouldn’t be the solution either, given the fact that making such electric cars will emit even more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. I immediately realized that, with those large factories operating at a huge scale on a daily basis, the atmospheric carbon dioxide is still a severe problem to consider. As a result, it prompted me to think that taking public transportation might the best solution to our problem now. In today’s world with highly advanced technologies, going everywhere is far more convenient with public transportation. However, people still prefer to buy cars, perhaps they view cars as a showcase of their identity, in other words, the social status. This is a negative aspect of the culture that needs to be changed urgently. If everyone perceives taking public transportation as a social norm instead of something that’s only for the poor people, then the number of people buying cars will also be reduced. Thirty years ago, people buy cars as a means to cope with the inconvenient traffic. Thirty years later in today’s world, the existence of the private vehicle is no more a “must.” With the greatly developed city networks of transportation, bus, subway, ferry all become potential good choices for our everyday method of going to places. Therefore, this lecture is very mind-opening to help me recognize the downside of producing, purchasing and using electric cars. As well, it successfully prompted me to realize the importance of taking public transportation methods in the future to make small yet efficient contributions to environmental problems.

I can totally agree with you! I never thought that electric cars would release so much CO2 during their manufacture.  Ever since I heard about electric cars it never even came up to me that the manufacturing process was also part of the problem. That is part of the much knowledge I did not have before taking this class. All this information that ken has delivered through this video makes me want to go back in time and say no to my dad when he offered to buy me a car. In that moment all I thought about was the feel of being “cool” with a car. I didn’t think that the decision I made was one to harm our planet. Again, that is how little knowledge I had. So, because of that I also think that public transportation is much better options. We even get to save the money we spend on gas and all the expenses we contribute to a car.
<br><br>
I also think that people should public transportation as something as something for every class of people even for the wealthy. If only we can find a way to convince everyone to do is, we would be doing the planet a huge favor. Now I feel the urge to share this information with my family since they are also pretty obsessed with having a car and feeling cool. I hope that they can also learn something and see the negative impact that a can do. Lastly I will continue to have hope that everyday people can realize this whole issue and the cause behind it so we can unite and commit to solutions.
<br><Hr>
Before I had a car, and I had to go from San Diego to LA and back, I would take the Amtrak. I have a car but not to show social status. I drive for the convenience of it. Ken said that public transportation is the more convenient option, to which you agreed along with others, but there are many ways that it isn’t. On the train, you have to make multiple stops and the trip can take hours longer than it would by car. Driving is also better economically for me. I would definitely take public transportation more often if it were cheaper. A train ticket for a trip between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles costs at least $30 and takes almost an hour more than driving. Because I drive a Hyundai Elantra and I get about 38 miles per gallon of gas, a trip to LA only costs me about $10 for gas. That’s a whole lot cheaper; being a student who is just getting the hang of living on my own, I make the majority of my decisions with my financial situation in mind. Of course I’m concerned about the environmental impacts of driving cars and reducing my carbon footprint, but I simply can’t afford to make my trips home via public transportation. I wish it weren’t this way, but unless the price of train tickets is suddenly cut in half, I don’t see how it will be possible for me to make the switch any time soon.

I was so surprised to find out that the production of electric cars produced more emissions than regular cars, because I never stopped to think about the environmental impact of producing a car, I had only thought of the emissions caused by driving it. 
<br><br>
I think it’s really important that we don’t get carried away with trying to be green and do our best to stay aware. It’s important that we realize alternatives also have an impact. When people began to give up plastic straws, they turned to reusable ones. But, to have the reusable straw (which won’t disintegrate either) shipped from Amazon, a lot of extra cardboard, plastic, and gas was used just for transportation. I’m not exactly sure how many plastic straws would have to be saved to offset that, but I would love to know if anyone does! I saw an ad for a reusable q-tip not to long ago and it made me laugh because cotton swabs are already biodegradable. I can see how someone’s intentions by buying the reusable q-tips are good, but the environmental impact is not. The production of that q tip produced emissions, so did having it shipped because it is likely not available in stores, and won’t disintegrate as easily as cotton will. Like Ken mentioned, it’s incredibly important that we not only reduce our consumption and move towards minimalism, but really pay attention to what we are consuming and the environmental impact that it has. 
<br><br>
It also amazed me that 1 gallon of gas could transport a person up to 750 miles by train. We could save so much money and help the environment so much by just using public transportation, but American culture doesn’t encourage that. As seen with the exponential growth in cars, the U.S. is a role model for other countries. As a result, I think one of the most impactful and beneficial things we would do is work towards popularizing public transportation because not only could it reduce Americans’ emissions, it could reduce the whole world’s.

It feels like sometimes people just miss the point with some trendy things like plastic straws. While sometimes these things can have a positive impact and decrease our waste, they can also serve as a distraction. Often people turn to these things to fulfill a personal feeling of responsibility. Instead of buying less clothing or eating less meat, someone can buy a reusable straw and feel like they are changing their habits for the planet. I used to see people at school with a regular plastic Starbucks cup and then a reusable straw. As far as decreasing waste, that picture represents a disconnect and a general lack of understanding about the environmental impacts of our consumption. While I don't want to dismiss any effort to lessen waste and save the planet, these trendy things do frustrate me because in some ways they end up distracting us from the root of the problem and actually just fuel our consumption culture. Something I am realizing as I am learning more about our food systems is that there really isn't a universal answer for living a sustainable life. This is important and it requires that we all understand the impacts of our personal consumption because all situations are different. We all have different carbon footprints and varying capacity to change certain aspects of our consumption. I want to better understand things that we can do personally to popularize and make more accessible public transportation.
<br><Hr>
Your response is very relatable. The same things that you are pointing out were the ones that stuck out to me the most. It's scary that even by trying to make a difference by buying things like reusable straws and q tips (didn't know that was a thing), we can be creating more damage than before. Like you said, I think it's important to raise awareness about the dangers of ordering things online etc. People may have good intentions, but intentions are not what is going to save the world. Also, as you said, I found it incredibly interesting that electric cars create more emissions than regular ones. Honestly, I found this statistic to be heartbreaking, because I really thought the electric car craze was going to be a factor that would greatly reduce carbon emissions- it is, on the contrary, doing the exact opposite. Overall, I agree with all of your sentiments about the lecture video, there are so many ways that we can help the environment, but many people are simply looking to the wrong things.
<br><hr>

I completely agree with your comment about being super aware with what we are consuming. In the rise of the climate movement, sustainable alternatives have become so trendy that I think we are prone to looking past their production and shipping impact. We pat ourselves on the back for buying something sold as eco-friendly and forget that it could still have the same environmentally detrimental impact as any other item. I was also really surprised to learn about the emissions of electric car production. In my mind, electric cars have always seemed like the best alternative. I think it’s really important to educate more people about this because I’m sure many believe the same. What was even more shocking to me was the fact that simply owning a car already covers an individual’s carbon emissions for their entire life. Most adults I know own more than one car and do not simply leave them in their driveways, showing how significantly every American is going over their emission limit. 
<br><br>
I also agree with your statement that we need to put a lot of work into making public transportation seem cool in American culture. I admit that I cannot imagine my life without my car and after watching Ken’s lecture I’m embarrassed by this. The message from popular culture that having a car means freedom has definitely become an ingrained association in my mind. I need to seriously rethink my views towards transportation. I think this is the case with many items in our lives. They become associated with a certain value that we can’t see ourselves living without, and we cannot extricate the object from the concept. This leads to extreme dependence on certain objects which is unhealthy for both ourselves and our planet.
<Br><hr>
I was also really surprised to learn from the lecture that the production of electric cars produces more emissions than the production of regular cars. I think we tend to think about the things that the product will produce and forget about the environmental effects caused by the production of items. This is unfortunate because the production of items is a large contributor to emissions. I think you made a very good point about not getting carried away with trying to be green and forgetting to look at all the stages of the items that we are consuming. This is a very important point because by getting carried away with trying to be green we can mistakenly focus on issues that are much smaller like reducing our plastic straw usage compared to reducing our meat consumption. It is unfortunate that the American culture discourages public transportation, because after visiting countries outside of the U.S. I got to see just how cost efficient and convenient public transportation is. It could also really help the environment as one gallon of gas can transport a person up to a staggering 750 miles by train. As Professor Hiltner mentioned, changing the perception of public transportation in the U.S. is a very important first step that we need to take.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with you, it’s crazy to see how people think they’re doing beneficial things such as buying reusable straws and reusable q tips. They think it’s the best for the planet but they’re wrong. Just like we’ve all been wrong thinking that electric cars produce no contribution to the carbon footprint, but we’ve been wrong. 

<br><br>
I was surprised to know that a manufactured car is equivalent to releasing two metric tons of co2, this means that simply by buying the car you have reached the maximum amount yearly. Now that’s crazy considering that there are car collectors out there who buy a new car when they want and get customized ones. I wonder if the rich know what damage they’re doing to the planet. It’s crazy that they could buy so many and obviously have no effects, meanwhile the poor can’t afford one. With that being said I found the statement on how having a car is cool, but riding the bus is not cool. And I feel like this has to do with social status. The rich own all the cars they want and are seen having the newest and most expensive, while the poor are using public transportation. That’s how we’ve all seen it, and I had not gotten on a bus before arriving at UCSB since there was no need for that back home.
<br><Br>

The data that Ken shared and I found most interesting was that the Us has fewer than 4% of the planet's population yet a quarter of the cars placed end to end would circle the earth 31 times, that’s unbelievable considering it’s just a quarter. This also goes back to how the US prioritizes car usage and has allowed it to get bigger after World War II. Another thing that surprised me was that a person has to pay around $9,000 yearly just for having a car. This goes back to how being a minimalist is a better option since there are other options such as public transportation which are cheaper and less responsibility.

When I was little, I used to think about life would be like in 2020. I believed that it would essentially be Meet the Robinsons– robots would run the world, time traveling would be the norm, and most importantly, we would have flying cars. Now that 2020 has come and nothing is even remotely the same of what I once thought, the one thing that has changed is the ambivalence around cars. From Tesla to BMW, electric cars are now the hot item on the market because of the rise of gas prices. More and more people have chosen to go efficiently in terms of their mode of transportation. In California, gas prices have rose to about $4 for gallon, making it incredibly expensive and a waste of time to even try to drive your car down the street. I always believed that electric transportation was the right choice to lead to a better future; it even saves you thousands of dollars on gas a year! Yet again, I was proved wrong. It never came to my understanding that every choice we make has an impact on our carbon footprint– even something as small as the food we eat– and how much it is harming our Earth. It never occured to me that electric cars would have this same effect.
<br><Br>
It is astonishing to me how much our society now relies on cars despite knowing and experiencing its effects firsthand. Ken stated how traffic injury became a worldwide epidemic, yet it is not even a viral disease. It is a man-made choice.
<br><br>
In the U.S. alone, a quarter of the cars we own would wrap around the entire planet not once, not twice, but thirty one times. THIRTY ONE TIMES! And that is only a quarter of the 5000 lb killing machines we spend almost all of our money on. Don’t get me wrong, I love driving and owning a car. Before coming to school here, I have never been on public transportation. I drove to highschool everyday despite it being 0.1 miles away because I wouldn’t dare wake up 5 minutes earlier to walk. Even before I drove, my parents would drive from downtown (about 20 minutes from my school) to pick me up and take me 0.1 miles away to our home. My house is basically an auto shop– there is about 9 or 10 cars (my uncle likes to buy cars and fix them) in my front yard, yet only 5 people in my house drive. Although these choices were mostly due to safety issues, I didn’t realize how much of an effect it would have on the environment. I could have made the choice to wake up and make breakfast to eat while walking to school, but I would rather use that extra 5 minutes to stay in bed and keep hitting snooze on my alarm like most would. Like Ken said, this precious time wasted drew attention away from the real problem of how much I actually drove. I knew that public transportation is cheaper, but I didn’t know that it would save the planet by so much more than I thought. Like getting up for school, I couldn’t be bothered to rely on other people to take me where I need to go when I could do it myself. I made my own choices, and now the planet is feeling its effects. I need to change.

I completely agree with you, Hannah. I think what really struck me about this lecture was when Professor Hiltner touched on the fact that most people are convinced technology is what is going to save us, but in reality, it has the capability to destroy us. It’s easy to be misinformed about the impact electric cars have on our environment because most people are told and believe that it’s an innovation that will prevent the release of CO2 and people don’t question that sentiment. However, cars will always release CO2 no matter if it’s electric or not. Another interesting facet of this lecture, for me, was when Professor Hiltner was discussing why people find owning a car to be so “cool” but not see buses in that light. I remember when I was in middle school and high school, I dreaded taking the bus and I would always beg my mom to drive me. We ended up making a trade-off that I would take the bus one way and she would take me the other. Looking back on it, I didn’t want to ride the bus because I thought it wasn’t “cool”. This comparison between public transportation and owning your own vehicle is all mental and is perpetuated by our society's belief that owning stuff makes everything better. My family has 5 cars and only 4 licensed drivers, leaving one car to barely be driven, which is completely unnecessary but it all ties back into consumerism and how our society runs on it. I really liked how you talked about traffic injuries being a worldwide epidemic and compared it to a viral disease. It is crazy that we are putting ourselves in these positions hurting ourselves, financially and physically, and harming the environment all in one.

This lecture truly showed me how living in a first world country makes us responsible for the actions of the rest of the world. Cars weren't as widespread and common as they were only prevalent in the United States and Europe. However, our influence on the rest of the world is great by the fact that now they've been adopted almost every where else in the world. India is now the fifth largest car market in the world, and the number continues to grow as within the next 15-20 years, the number of cars will double to 2 billion. The rest of the world's infatuation was caused by what we had and practiced in the first place, therefore if we encourage sustainability and enforce it into our own lives, that will in result in influencing lesser developed countries to do so. The idea of the life cycle of cars took me by surprise. I had thought that the zero emission automobiles were beneficial but in reality the creation of the car itself, without ever driving it, is equivalent to the emissions of a human in their whole lifespan. This lecture really showed that instead of trying to produce emission free cars, we should instead turn our attention to car use, and limit that as a whole instead. Technology cannot get us out of this problem, but our attitudes towards cars will. Many think that it is "uncool" to take public transit, which is why it is important to study why humans think this way. In this case, the issue is a social one, and science can only tell us how we are changing the planet but not why. By truly using the social sciences to study this, we could get to the root of the problem and collectively adapt better lifestyle choices.

I completely agree, I have also come to realize the living in a first world country is responsible for many of the leading factors contributing to the downfall of our environment. The innovation of a personal automobile--a convenient way of traveling; no more waiting for the bus, or hailing down a taxi cab. With your own car, you leave on your own watch without paying per ride. The car left our world starstruck but also left it in a worse off condition. It's a shame that the most efficient way to solve this problem is to restructure the norm of society: to reject or vastly limit the use of cars. It seems like we almost have to erase this convenient innovation and it really does feel impossible because convenience is the big word that describes our current generation. 
<br><Br>
In addition, I completely agree about using social sciences. We can invent many environmentally efficient "solutions" with science such as electric cars--but the act of making a car is already costly even if the car itself is less harmful than other cars. Science can only do so much, but people--our actions and the choices we make--are the root to whether or not the effects of climate change can be fixed/reversed
<br><Hr>
Some may say that they don’t want to ride the bus because it is “uncool” but personally I don’t want to bus everywhere not because it isn’t cool but because it is very inconvenient and unreliable. When I was in junior high, I would have to take the bus to school because that was the only way for me to get there. I would have to leave my house an hour early so I could get to school on time. I would take me at least 45 minutes to get to campus which was only three and a half miles from my house. That is if the bus was on time and everything went right. I was so annoying and I think that we need to change the system in public transportation if that is the way that we want to move forward. 
<br><br>
 Even if the creation of a car emits the same amount of carbon into the atmosphere as a single person in their lifespan it is still better to have an electric car than a gas car. Yes they both will emit a lot of carbon when it is created but the gas car will continue to emit carbon, while the electric car won’t. If we switch to fully renewable energy, the electric car will emit almost 0 carbon into the atmosphere when being created and used. I just think that we need to change the ways we are producing cars and what type of cars and we could still live in a world where we don’t have to fully switch to public transit.
<br><Hr>
I liken the climate impact of cars to disease control: prevention is far better than treatment when possible. Creating alternatives to cars entirely, similarly, is a better option than producing an emission-free car. The difficult part here, as you mention, is changing the culture. Telling people, especially many Americans, to simply not have any cars is an absurd notion when considering the greater culture surrounding cars in the US. Cars have become inevitably ingrained in our culture, and within that are notions of independence and freedom that a car can bring. To take away someone's car is to take some key part of their freedom, or at least that's the way it's viewed. In reality, cars are almost extremely deadly, able to kill us instantly in high speed crashes and slowly over long drives. Owning a particularly expensive car is seen as an immensely powerful status symbol, and many people will make modifications to just make their cars louder (speakers or exhaust). This kind of culture should be transferred over to the bus and other public transport: activists and politicians should make efforts to make taking public transportation cool for the middle class and those who often commute by car. Perhaps a toned down version of the ad campaign Germany did a while back for bicycle helmets could help. 
<br><br>
The main takeaway here is to push against car culture and more importantly, neoliberalism. The notion that the system will fix itself through new technologies may work for many markets, but not for cars when even building the car is extremely carbon intensive. Instead, private companies and the government can give nudges towards a particular mode of transport. For example, having good bike lanes is key to safety and actually getting more people to commute by bike. Many don't have a choice for commuting by bike, and they are particularly vulnerable to poor infrastructure coming out of their neighborhood/suburb. Ideally, these would come from raised lanes separate from the sidewalk and the road, like in Copenhagen. Once the infrastructure is there, more and more people will use it. Technology could be employed here to solve issues related to implementing bike infrastructure, which would be a far better investment than trying to create a zero-emission car.
<br><hr>
I also believed that zero emission cars were a great solution for reducing CO2 emissions. It was new information for me to learn about how the manufacturing of such cars is really detrimental for the environment, and I was really surprised as well that owning a zero emissions car without driving it is equivalent to a human's lifetime of emissions. It's unfortunate, because these new zero emissions cars seemed really promising and actually gave me a lot of hope when I would see them being used, and when I would see charging stations in parking garages and such. But Ken is right, as much as technology can help us combat the rising levels of greenhouse gases and the climate crisis, we really do need a cultural shift just as much, if not more. People view public transit as dirty and lower-class as of now, and from my life experience at least, it seems wealthy people in America are very reluctant to public transportation. That being said, I feel like we just don't have many popular options of public transit in the United States. Aside from the major cities, a lot of the country is rural and suburban, and the lifestyle of living in those areas really does require a car. So, as we continue to build our cities and neighborhoods, we should plan and place buildings/centers/stores in a way that is less dependent on cars, and we should also work to incentivize public transit, and change the culture around it.
<br><hr>
I agree on the fact that living in a first world country simply can simply make us ignorant to the fact that we contribute on much more than we think on the world. Especially in a first world country, the supply and demand on cars is massive here in the United States. Cars are known to be the most popular way to get around in America, but it is also a luxury that many rich individuals continue to buy as collection more than for daily use. I believe that those who purchase more and more cars for luxury collection simply do now understand the negative factors that this action contributes to the world. I also agree with thinking zero emission automobiles being more beneficial, which simply took me by surprised that even these cars that we believe if better for the environment, simply is not. The more we continue to use cars and even build cars, plays another major factor toward climate crisis that I believe not many of us ever knew about--including myself. It intrigues me to listen to the fact that building cars in general, even if it's known to be "environment-friendly"--which initially is not--affects the world we live in as well. At this point, I'm starting to think that literally almost everything we do affects our world in a negative way. I agree that public transit can help this issue even by a little bit; although, I also agree that many individuals do not resort to public transit due to the fact that many people think it is "uncool." Although it may seem uncool, it can help with the emission problems we create with driving cars. There is no problem with taking public transportation, when literally so many people around the world live off of this form of transportation and simply get to where they need to be.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with what you said. After watching this week’s mini-lecture, I was impressed by the fact that even a manufactured car with zero miles per year will release two metric tons of carbon dioxide, and this is already equivalent to our standard amount of carbon dioxide emissions per year without even considering our daily emission like household-related and recreational activities. Knowing the situation that automobiles have gradually become basic necessities for almost every household all over the world, the data mentioned above hit me when hearing it. Then I realize that this basically means such a car-accessible world would make the climate crisis even worse.
<br><br>
I would like to say that creating zero-emission cars seems not to be a plausible solution for dealing with our climate crisis, both environment-wise and technology-wise. Nowadays, people usually define their success as purchasing luxurious cars and drive them around to showcase their high-level consumption, and sort of look down upon those people who are taking public transportations. That’s totally a cultural problem. I think that the climate crisis is not fading away until we change our culture of the use of cars. Admittedly, improving technologies is absolutely an important task for us to accomplish; but changing our mindset precedes everything else.

I completely agree that in order for humanity to repair the damage that we have done to the environment, we must make extreme cultural and social changes. Technological advancements are nice, but if we somehow figure out how to make goods with, say 1/4th the amount of energy, then companies would just make 4 times as many products, and consumers would just consume 4 times as much. We need to not only change the way we make goods and the way we harvest energy, but our actions and habits as well. Reducing is the first verb in the hierarchy of reduce, reuse, and recycle for a reason. As a society we need to stop putting our worth and value into things. I find it very unsettling that the production of a car uses up a person’s entire C02 allotment for almost 10-15 years. This is not okay. This plus everything else that a person does to emit C02 means that we are sprinting towards an uninhabitable world, and only severely reducing our greenhouse gas emissions will give us a chance of turning back around. I think that there was so much potential wasted when huge developed countries decided to promote the production and consumption of personal automobiles instead of creating a way better public transit system. I think that improving the public transportation system could still greatly benefit our personal lives and the planet, but it will be way harder now because of the systems and cultures already in place. We are so used to having highways and owning personal cars and these things are so ingrained into our lives that causing a major change like this would be very difficult. But saving the world will not be easy, so while I think it will be hard, it absolutely needs to be done. I love biking to school and taking the train to go back home and I would love for more people to be able to do the same things.

I completely agree that it is the mindset of the general public that needs to change.  Some people believe in the notion that we must continue to generate new technology in order to create something that will magically solve all of our problems for us, but this lecture has made me look at the costs of a life-cycle of a piece of technology.  The fact that the costs to ship and make a car will make a person use up their lifetime CO2 allotment if they simply buy, not even drive, a car every 11 years is terrifying.  We as a society need to stop building and trying to find new technologies that work and instead should focus on the ones that already have proven to work.  We need to put our time and resources into making public transportation "cool" and not buy into the car-hungry propaganda that the vehicle industry has shoved down our throats in order to continue to sell us our project.
<br><Br>
Reduce, reuse, and recycle is important, but there is one more that should be put in front to consider before you do anything-- REFUSE!  Refuse to buy a product if you don't need it.  Refuse to give into the societal pressures of owning the most luxurious but gas-guzzling cars on the market.  Refuse to be a large contributor to our earth warming above two degrees Celsius.  I understand that it is hard and there needs to be a large-scale social movement in order for a lot of people to get on board, but individuals can start in small ways by not using their cars as often and opting to use public transportation whenever they can.  
<br><br>
This idea of refusal coincides with the idea of minimalism, and not living beyond ones means.  People in America do not need to be giving into consumer culture as much as we are, we can live off of way less things and in less convenient ways, but we are so accustom to the ways that large corporations have shaped us into being.  By living simply, you can declutter your life and focus on the things that bring you joy.  Say one of the things that brings your happiness is a great book, then you will have so much more time to read it on the bus on the way to work!

While I understand that there is such a large environmental impact from both building and driving cars, I don't see the need for them ever going away, at least for some time. The same can be said about planes as well, people will always need to be somewhere or go somewhere fast which is why we will always need some sort of transportation system. Whether it's a bus or a car or some new thing, there will always be some sort of environmental impact going on. I see how riding the bus helps, but I don't see a reality where we can convince everyone to take the bus. Theres so many different places that people need to get to or be at, that some alternate form of transportation will always be needed.

I understand where you are coming from in this comment. Of course public transportation or walking/ biking is easier in the city because everything is relatively close in proximity and it is more convenient to not worry about traffic or parking. However, I am from a town where the nearest grocery store is miles away and the practicality of my parents waiting a bus stop that is at least a mile away and then walk home with all the groceries is just a lot to ask of people. No one is ever going to the same place with the same urgency in mind so it is really hard to see a future with no cars even though is would be so beneficial for the environment.

Watching this lecture really made me question myself and the lifestyle that I choose to live. When school is in session and I’m in Isla Vista, I don’t drive. I walk to my classes and to my apartment; I don’t have a car here, and if I ever am in one it’s because a friend of mine is driving me somewhere. However, when I am back home in Los Angeles, driving is a quintessential part of my life. When I’m at home, I drive on average, every day, at least 20 miles. This is because I live roughly 10 miles from my old hometown and I always go there to see my friends, hang out, eat, etc, so the roundtrip plus driving to other places around town easily adds up to over 20 miles a day. I don’t drive an electric car nor a hybrid either, so there’s a lot of gas involved and I refuel very often. I recognize that this is disastrous to the environment. Yet, this is a lifestyle that I choose to have when I am at home, because it brings me happiness to drive around and see my friends and hang out. As Ken correctly pointed out in this lecture video however, it is so much better for the environment to commute, to ride buses or use the metro; a cultural shift regarding car use is necessary to cut back on the emissions released into the atmosphere caused by driving. Yet I, like millions of others, would find such a change in lifestyle too drastic or maybe just inconvenient to pull off. 
<br><br>
I think that in the future, there will definitely be some kind of cultural shift regarding transportation. However, it will not happen, in my opinion, until climate change has brought even worse consequences to the planet than we are facing right now at this moment. Not until more of the drastic and horrible effects of climate change hit us will we be able to, as a society, really take the necessary steps to change our lives and move away from the lifestyles that facilitated and exacerbated the climate crisis in the first place. That, I think, is the sad truth. By that point, it’s likely that hundreds of thousands if not millions of people will have been directly affected, and by affected I mean harmed, by the effects of the climate catastrophe. I only hope that by that point - the point at which we as humans will finally be able to collectively bring ourselves to change and act against the crisis - I hope that by that point it’s not too late.

I feel the same way with regard to traveling when back in my hometown. The lack of public transportation makes it very difficult for me to easily access my friends and family without spending a ridiculous amount of time traveling. However, when I am in Isla Vista I refuse to take a car anywhere. I would love to continue this lifestyle outside of Isla Vista, however, it is just too unrealistic for me to not drive my car when back at home. If I lived in the city I would be able to walk virtually anywhere, but not in the suburbs that are extremely hilly.

I completely agree that Americans rely too much on cars and too little on public transportation. I think it is essential for communities to build better public transportation that enables more people to utilize it. For example, maybe an express lane on highways that only allows buses to use it would help incentivize the switch to public transportation. However, when Ken argues that it is a “simple” switch I believe he is not taking into account the complexity of this issue. I do not believe that the American people were tricked into buying cars by politicians and manufacturers marketing them as ‘cool’. I believe that Americans have become obsessed with cars because they provide a better service for the consumer than public transportation. I would definitely rather take a ride in a clean car than a filthy bus or subway. I aint trying to get coronavirus ken.
<br><br>
Also I really don't understand how you criticize elon musk when he is actually making a difference to help limit carbon dioxide. For most people the question is not public transportation or buying a car, it is what kind of car are you going to buy and electric cars are still definitely better for the environment than cars that run on petroleum. Not to mention the fact that elon musk’s success has inspired a lot of companies and people to build more electric cars and sustainable substitutes for products that rely on fossil fuels. Because of this I don't think you can criticize musk's proposed solutions to solve the climate crises when he has done more to combat it than you.

It's really irritating that cars are so essential to life, especially due to the anxiety and anger that cars and traffic invoke. Public transportation tech exists and it's amazing, but it's not accessible enough to working class Americans! This is because of the huge part of the economy dedicated to suburbia and having a car. Taking the bus sometimes takes 2+ hours, and people who work to put food on the table cannot afford that loss of time, but cannot afford a car either.
<br><br>
I think that the used car industry actually has a fair amount of merit. Buying new cars boosts demand and the industry, but buying used cars takes yourself out of the production loop. It is time to shift our focus from creating new technology to making our current technology more accessible, affordable, and efficient. The jobs that are lost in the new car industry can be repurposed to the public transportation industry. This will also help control anxiety among the populace and boost community.

Before I watched this video, I thought buying an electric car was the best way to protect our earth by reducing burning fossil fuels and decreasing carbon dioxide. However, through this video, if we need to control temperature increase about two degrees, we need to control our carbon dioxide releasing about 2 tons per year. But when we buy an electric car, it will release two tons of carbon dioxide per year. As a Chinese, I was surprised when I heard that China is the biggest car demand market. In 1985, there were about 1.78 million cars in China. But in 2017, China has 172 million cars. For just thirty years, it has increased by about 10000%. It is an astonishing number to know. In fact, no matter how much high-technologies reduce car pollution, cars will always cause pollution. Instead of buying an electric car, what we need to do is take public transportations, walk or ride bicycles. From my perspective, in China, I think most people would like to take the high-speed rail to travel instead of driving cars. Not only because it is the most efficient and convenient way, but also it takes less money. The Chinese government has invested a lot of money in protecting the environment. So what we need to do is drive less and take public transportations in our daily life.

   I agree with the first part of your comment Chuyi Wang, I also thought that buying an electric car is the most efficient way to decrease greenhouse gases. But after watching this lecture I now know that is not true, I really never consider that making the car itself emits gases that affects our atmosphere. Knowing this really made me think if I actually need a car. I still do not have my driver's license and my mom and grandma keep on bugging me to get one; however, I really do not see any point to get one. First of all, I do not even have a car (nor the money to maintain one) and secondly I mainly take the bus to go to stores like Target or Costco. I see how having a car is convenient because you can buy groceries and not have to carry it on the bus but, if we just buy what we actually need then we would not be struggling with carrying groceries. Just having a car emits so much greenhouse gases and wastes a lot of money. Knowing that if you do not have a car, you can retire in your late 40’s  instead of 65 sounds so good. You still have so much time to be free and do fun things before you get too old.  Having a car kind of reminds me of forbidden fruit, It is good to have but you should not.

This is a great video, I enjoyed it a lot. Ken explains his idea thoroughly by using statistical data. It is very true that at this moment change the way of engineering cars is not that effective. However, changing the culture is more crucial. This video reminded me of the video from Ken last week. These two videos together demonstrate a great idea of lifestyle changing tips. People generally think switching to Tesla will be a good choice to protect our earth by producing zero greenhouse gases. However, the part they do not know is that the process of manufacturing cars also releases a significant amount of greenhouse gases. Mass transit is a really great future development for every city in the world. As the population continues to be grown in the future, towns will be developed into cities eventually. Apartments will be constructed, instead of houses. Big and tall buildings allow more people to live in the same area, but constructing more houses is not realistic. When the population density is high, mass transit will be more effective. 
<br><br>
I lived in New York for many years before I came to California. The best way to get to your destination fast in NYC is by taking the subway. Yes, there are a lot of Ubers in the city, but when cars are packed together, the traffic is slow. Therefore, the subway is the best choice of daily commute. NYC also has those tall apartment buildings. Even buildings in LA are not as dense as in NYC. Therefore, we need to shift our lifestyle and the government should push the construction of mass transit or public transportations. Imagine, if UCSB has a school bus or there are more buses in the town (on time buses), and more bike lanes are constructed, I believe more students at UCSB will choose to take the bus or bike to school, which will reduce our carbon prints significantly.

I was shocked when I heard that Ken said that not only using the car will produce a large amount of carbon dioxide, but also producing these cars will release a much more severe carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Because of this fact, I think the most important thing for people who live in modern society to consider is not how to reduce the carbon dioxide released by one car, instead of it, we should solve this problem fundamentally. To be honest, I don't think that the demand for the car should be such high in the world. Technology is developing at a fast speed. If you told me that people have an inconvenience in traveling, which forces them to buy a car, 20 years ago, I would absolutely believe this. Because at that time, technology is not advanced and the most popular public transport is the bus, which is so slow that they need people to spend a lot of time on the roads. However, a vast amount of countries have a subway, which is much faster than the bus. To give an example about Shenzhen, the city I grew up, owned eight subway lines, and plans to build more than 15 subway lines in the future. People can arrive in most places in our cities by subway and the time spend on it is even less than driving the car. This kind of public transport is more convenient, more environmentally friendly, much cheaper, and faster. However, people still choosing to buy a car. Some of them hold the opinion that car is a type of symbolism of their identity. They want to show to other people that they have enough money to buy a car. This can be understood but is ridiculous. If this kind of cultural problem can be solved, and this idea can be changed fundamentally, I believed that more and more people in the future would choose to use a more environmentally friendly way to travel.

Ken brought up some interesting counter arguments for the use of electric cars when it has been widely accepted that electric cars are one of the ways our society can save our planet. One of the main points that he brought up that I hadn’t thought about before was the fact that 3 in 4 cars have only one person in them, and these 5,000 pound vehicles are being used to transport only one person. If you add together the emissions that have come from aking that 5000 pound car and the emissions from the car running, you begin to get into astronomically high numbers when it comes to damage to our planet per each person. As Ken had said in the video, I agree that many people are coming to conclusions too soon when it comes to switching over to electric cars. Yes, using an electric car will lower gaseous emissions from the use of the car in itself, but the harmful emissions that would be released just to make the car may outweigh the pros as well. Another question is raised by this conundrum: Where would all the gas cars go when people en masse want to make the switch to electric cars all together? This would produce a lot of unnecessary waste as people try to throw out / get rid of their gas cars, and I’m worried about what impact all that waste is going to have on our planet in the long run.

I have thought about this as well with the talk of collectively switching to electric cars over gas. Where WOULD the billions of cars on Earth go if everyone switched to electric cars, causing billions of more cars to be made due to the high demand? It is a tricky question that has many answers, but stopping the use of cars altogether may be too progressive for humans for our current habits. However, utilizing public transportation over cars can massively lower one's carbon footprint, which I actively support and stand behind.

The statistics presented in the video astonished me. My dad owns an electric vehicle that claims to be zero emission. Although I feel better when my family travels in his car as opposed to my mom’s gas guzzling SUV, I now realize that electric cars are not all that better and environment saving as I used to believe. It’s crazy to me that simply purchasing a car takes up all of the allotted CO2 for an individual per year without even driving it – which is the purpose of having a car. 
<br><Br>
I understand that utilizing public transportation is a much better and environmentally friendly option to owning and operating your own car. Since starting school at UCSB, I’ve been taking the bus more often than I used to. I really appreciate Ken’s emphasis on the use of public transportation. However, I don’t think people will ever stop owning cars. Certainly, a percentage of the population will transition to taking the bus or train more often, but I think that the vast majority of people favor their cars. Like Ken mentioned, they are “cool” and symbolize freedom, but even more than that, they’re indicators of wealth and the American dream. In the video, it was mentioned that an entire cultural flip would have to occur in order for the climate crisis to be undone. That’s very true, but is it possible in the span of our lifetime? Is it possible to do so in time to save our planet? Change takes time and a willingness to conform. Consumerism is a fundamental part of America’s founding. People believe owning stuff is one of the benefits that you reap when you work hard and earn money. Cars are a prime example of one of the things that people desire to have.

<br><Br>
I know this makes me sound like a pessimist, but maybe if public transportation was, as Ken said, cooler, diminishing our carbon footprint through the displacement of cars would be possible. I’m just not sure how it could be done.

I was also astonished by the statistics presented in the video.  My mom also owns an electric vehicle that claims to be zero emissions; I thought that this was much better for the environment as opposed to traditional cars.  Thus, I was very surprised to learn that simply purchasing a car takes up the ideal co2 emissions of an individual per year without even driving it.  Additionally, I did not realize the huge economic investment owning a car is.  It is crazy to me how widely utilized they are although I am not surprised.

Just like you said, owning a car is not only a symbol of freedom but an indicator of wealth and the accumulation of succeeding the american dream.  While public transportation systems are so sustainable and sometimes easier than driving a car, the issue is that they are just not “cool.”  People want to show off their wealth, promote their social standing, and attempt to capitalize their happiness, and public transportation does not typically fit into this model.  Since starting school at UCSB, my main methods of transportation are biking and taking the bus; this never hinders my ability to get where I need to go.  Additionally, it feels good to be able to bike to places that I would normally drive to.  One of the big issues with moving to these alternative means of transportation is that there are not many good public transportation systems in many cities across the United States.  When I discovered that this had to do with the federal investment in cars and roads after world war 2, I was a little disappointed.  When the federal government could have been investing in economically and environmentally sustainable methods, they chose to do what would be most profitable.  I agree with your assertion of pessimism; I believe that although a mass transition away from cars is possible, I do not see it happening as quickly as it needs to.

    I completely agree with you. Our society is definitely able to make the switch to prioritizing public and cleaner transportation methods, such as trains, subways, buses, bikes and walking. However, we are unwilling to do so because of the convenience of personal vehicles and what they represent. Before I had my own car, my friends and I would either take CalTrain or use Uber/Lyft if we needed to get somewhere and our parents couldn’t take us. While CalTrain was always a fun and interesting experience, my parents would warn me, a fifteen-year-old girl traveling with her other teenage friends to the city, to be safe. And a lot of the times, the closest CalTrain station was pretty far from where we needed to be.

To make this switch to a public transportation-focused society, it would require a restructuring of major cities, like where I live near San Francisco and the greater Bay Area. Although Portland and Vancouver have become increasingly more bike-friendly and New York has an effective subway system, implementing something similar in San Francisco would require a lot of work and commitment, especially considering the topography of the area. Now, this shouldn’t deter policymakers from supporting and believing in the cause. I truly do want to see change occur in our mass transportation systems, but I don’t think it’ll happen soon.

Before taking english 23, I never recognize that manufacturing a car will release so much co2. I used to think that electronic car will solve this problem. But it seems like manufacturing a electronic car will still be harmful to the environment. As a result, if we really want to save our planet, we should take the bus, train and subway more instead of driving car. What we should do here is to make public transportation cooler. Because the public transportation is cheaper but it is not very convenient now. The government should try to make it more convenient and cooler. In this situation, the use of the public transportation will increase dramatically.

I agree people do not want to give up cars so they simply hope that someday a zero emissions car will be created, but just as Ken stayed that is very unrealistic. It goes back to the idea that people do not want to give up anything that inconveniences them at the moment although it may benefit them in the long term. I think it will be extremely difficult trying to get people to give up cars. I do think public transportations that is more efficient and more environmentally friendly is a good solution. Still I do not see that idea working because people rather have the freedom to be able to travel where they want than be restricted by time schedules or having to go through the hassle of going on the transportation. Another thing is that there are a lot of people so there would be a need to have more subways and busses. Although I do think the public transportation is more realistic than a completely zero emissions car. Yeah I think Ken’s comment about how one of his students mentioned that there needs to be a change in the outlook of public transportation and for it to be made thought of as trendy. 
<br><br>
I was shocked at Ken’s statement about how the United States has less than four percent of the world’s population, yet a quarter of the world’s population. I think Americans really enjoy the liberty to be able to go anywhere. It is interesting the point that Ken makes about how the economy post the war relied on high industrialized production of automobiles to keep the economy going. It is interesting to think how influenced the public was by the public was by car manufacturers and politicians about feeling that cars were popular. I think the main reason, cars took off was because during the early production of cars they were expensive and only well off people could afford them, thus they represented success.  This connects back to Walden by Thoreau, about how people seek happiness from ownership of possessions and how  materialistic society has become. I think if society focused less on how “cool” things looked and making most out of fewer things, our environment would greatly impact from it.

Convenience and comfort are two words that come to my mind when thinking about cars as a form as transport. Cars in America offer us the ability to pick up and leave anywhere within a matter of minutes. Unfortunately, the same can not be said about public transportation. As a freshman living off campus this year I have experienced the public transportation system, first hand and have actually come to quite enjoy using the bus. However, with using the bus it is true that I have to plan my day more methodically in order to ensure that I have enough time to get where I need to be. For this reason alone, I see why many Americans choose to just hop in their cars and go instead of waiting to get cramped into a bus with a bunch of other people, especially in America where the public transport system is less than adequate in most places outside of large urban centers. In regards to the whole biking thing, yea it is nice once in a while when the weather is nice, but it's ultimately tiresome if you are not someone who enjoys forcefully partaking in extended cardiovascular activity to show up to class hot and sweaty. This is precisely why I think the government should simply put more funding into expanding transit systems to make them more accessible and to advertise the economic benefits that Ken laid out. The idea of retiring in your late 40s is a very compelling pull factor in my opinion. For instance, the idea of making high speed electric rails a new luxurious and glamorous mode of transcontinental transportation I think could greatly reduce our nation's reliance on flying. I have experienced the likes of things such as Amtrak and simply put they are not the most comfortable or compelling to consistently want to ride. Americans love their cars, and for good reason in my opinion. Sometimes having an independent method of getting around without having to worry about catching a train or sitting next to a smelly person is a comforting idea. However in stating that, I do believe that we need to expand our public transportation methods for everyday tasks such as work or school. I also believe that one family could make do with having only one, SMALL, car for long trips or emergencies while incorporation more methods of public transportation into their everyday lives. Although it is a complex issue that has been presented, it does come down to a necessary culture change; humans have no reason to be willingly reliant on cars for everyday life so much other than the fact that they are innately lazy and complacent with the convenience of them.

I completely agree with your comment. Convenience and comfort are the biggest aspects as to why people stick with their cars. I too am a freshman who lives off campus and has dealt with the bus system and biking. Biking is a great option but I hate showing up to class sweaty and its hard if you’re sick. The buses, while great, do have their issues as they are not as reliable and I have had to wait at the bus stop and be late to class because the buses were late. Due to this, I have at times considered calling a Lyft to take me to school because the buses were so late or wished I had my car. It is a hard problem because cars are undeniably convenient and people often choose convenience in all aspects of their life. I agree with Ken’s comments about how cities are environmentally better when it comes to transportation as people often rely on public transportation there more so than in the suburbs. My hometown is a suburb where you have to drive to get everywhere, or it is at least the norm and the easiest way to get anywhere since everything is so spread out. Cars are frankly the norm because they are seen as cool. In the affluent neighborhood where I lived, my high school’s parking lot was filled with cars as it was seen as the normal rite of passage to get a car once you turned 16 and got your license. I have seen my friends families with an unnecessary amount of cars that go unused or gas guzzling trucks and SUVs for no reason. Public transportation (buses) are not used at all by the vast majority of people and that needs to change. The best thing the government can do is stop subsidizing and promoting the car industry and rather focus on public transportation infrastructure and actually making it appealing. It is a no brainer that public transportation in LA (where I’m from) is not used because it is deeply underfunded, does not have a wide travel range and is not the timely answer. The government needs to shift its focus and offer public transportation as an equally competitive alternative to cars, because we truly do not need to be driving the way we do due to the car culture in America. The average family does not need one car per person, and people need to be offered good alternatives to make them stop their obsession with cars - not to mention it’s more cost effective since cars are outrageously expensive to purchase and maintain.

I couldn’t agree more with everything you have said Joshua. Being a first year as well, the one thing I miss from home is my car. It truly is one of the most convenient and comfortable modes of transportation. I live in the Santa Catalina dorms, which are off campus. The first two weeks of school I biked to class and every time I was exhausted. I then started to bus and continue doing that to this day. My problem with the bus system is that now I have to wake up earlier, check the bus schedule and leave enough time to get to the bus stop. This everyday process takes up a half hour of my morning. After my late sections, I have to walk to the North Hall Bus Loop and wait in the cold for the bus to come. While this doesn’t seem that bad, there are usually thirty other people waiting to catch the bus with me and some of us will not be able to fit on. 
<br><br>
I’d also agree that a government funded mass transit system would be beneficial for all. Systems like subways and trains aren’t commonly found in places outside of large cities. Inhabitants of cities like New York and Boston don’t find the need for cars but everyone outside in the suburbs or smaller cities don’t have that luxury. Everyone at my highschool needed a car to get to school, work and back home. While I wish one large mass transit could be the solution to all our problems, I can’t see how that would actually work out.

I believe that in response to the climate crisis, we have to change certain aspects of the way we live. We would need to “rewrite cultural practices”, as Ken mentioned. I think a reason why people prefer a vehicle over public transportation is because you can hop into your car and drive wherever you like and have that sense of ‘freedom’. Here in Goleta we have easy access to public transportation, but I choose to use my car to get around because I find it stressful to rely on the times the bus runs. Although, I do prefer and find that walking and biking to get around IV or onto campus is convenient. The area in which we live allows us to change our mode of transportation, but not everyone has the same advantage. Back at the city I live in , they barely began to incorporate bike lanes as they renewed the roads around our community. When I go back and visit, I never see anyone on the bike lanes because everyone is used to being in their personal vehicles. We also have easy access to public buses around the area but they are often empty compared to the ones here in Goleta. I see that the city is trying to make progress in the ways in which we can limit vehicle use but I believe they are failing to inform the community about the reasons for these new additions.
 <br><br>
 I do believe we’ll find a way to minimize CO2 emissions caused by vehicles, but I think it’ll be a challenge because there are so many factors to consider. As Ken mentioned, I do think we need to better understand the desires of the people and study our culture.

I agree with your statement, “Although, I do prefer and find that walking and biking to get around IV or onto campus is convenient. The area in which we live allows us to change our mode of transportation, but not everyone has the same advantage.” We as UCSB students are fortunate to live in a community that offers free transportation for students (albeit we pay for it in our tuition). However, my friends and I have often lamented in not having a car. We remark that we’d go out more and see more of Santa Barbara’s beautiful scenery if we had a car. Sure it takes a while to get to Downtown or Trader Joe’s on the bus (roughly 20-30 minutes) but at least we get there. This is when I realized that we were so used to driving cars back home that we ourselves were preventing us from exploring simply because we did not have a vehicle. I remember that when I lived in an apartment block with six different units, each housing 4-5 people, each had 4-5 cars. That meant there were 24-30 cars in a parking lot built for only 12. When my family and I moved into our current home, we sold off our 2 “nice cars” and kept our 2 “working ones.” My neighbors, however, have around 6-10 cars in their driveway. Not only that but they feel the need to wash each of them at home with a hose and bucket, often creating a small stream that trickles down blocks. We often think of driving as a right but in reality it is a luxury. And with the way we are using up our natural resources, it is a luxury we will soon no longer be able to make. I believe that California, the 5th largest economy in the world, as a government should invest in safer and cheap transportation like the Bullet Train in Japan. It is feasible, so why has it not been built? Bus and train transportation should be mainstreamed and trendy just like vegetarianism and thrifting is today. By educating the youth that individual cars is not as necessary as we think we will be able to achieve this.

<br><hr>
There is definitely an important cultural component that comes in play when we do talk about mass transit. 
<br><br>

Picture yourself on a bus. Look around. what do you see around you? Maybe some smelly homeless man to your right and the friendly neighborhood crackhead to your left. We have been taught to associate public transport like buses and trolley with poverty. Since these people are on this cheaper mode of transport they must not be able to afford a car. Unfourtunelty, I cannot admit to being any better than this. Despite being educated on this topic, the idea of public transit always seemed gross to me. 
<br><br>

Now picture someone driving a car. They're so independent, living life so luxuriously. Luxury cars are a classic way to display wealth. Cars are an important part of the American culture. For some, cars are their entire hobby, identity. Take away their car and they have nothing.
<br><br>

In a lot of countries, public transit isn't ridiculed like it is here. In fact, in many Asian countries, public transit is the prime way of getting around. We need to normalize public transit here, and invest I it. One should be able to get around the 48 continental states without having to drive or fly. 
<br><br>

Public transit, like buses, trolley, and the subway should also be free. This will increase its use and destigmatize it.

I think that people rely too much on technology now since technological improvement has solved lots of problems that happened before. Technology can improve our efficiency of use of resources, but, at the end of the day, we need to consume resources to drive technology. We have been waiting for a genius who comes up with a brilliant technological innovation that can solve this problem, but if there is really is a technological solution, we should at least have a clue or insight by now. It’s been a long time since we are fully aware of the harms and impacts that climate change brought to us.

When Professor Ken mentioned about taking public transportation, it makes me think of my hometown, Beijing, China. When I was in China, I looked at the news every morning, and it reports the passenger flow volume each day. Usually, there will be nearly 10 million people take subways. I didn’t know how big the influence on environmental problems is going to be. I just thought that this is a big number of people.
<br><br>

I think governments should promote public transportation by lowering ticket prices and increasing public transportation quality. It does not only solve environmental problems, but also traffic problems and scarce oil problems. I know that countries are competing with each other through how many things they can produce and how many purchase power that people have. However, the cost of this is severe. Daily transportation is important to everyone. Taking public transportation does not mean that you are poor. We need to change how we think of this. Taking public transportation means you are willing to make your own contribution to our society.

I 100% agree with you. Technology runs most of our lives now, and we are constantly waiting for the next best thing. While technology can be very useful, we have to understand the impacts that come with creating it. I had no idea that the production of electric cars produces large amounts of emissions. I see why people argue that electric cars were the way to go because no one is thinking about the production. I don’t even have a car so I take public transportation all the time, and it’s not even that bad. I get why people hate it but there are major cons to owning a car as well. I guess it’s just the fact that you can get to where you need to without necessarily having to wait nor do you have to risk being cramped on a crowded bus. 

<br><br>
Transportation quality definitely needs to be fixed in certain areas. Los Angeles is terrible with public transportation as it’s never consistent so people feel better just driving to where they need to be. That logic is what makes traffic worse and thus the buses take longer. If more people would accept public transport then traffic wouldn’t even be as big of a problem. My roommate and I were talking about how Elon Musk wanted to solve the traffic problem by having underground freeways. She was saying that she believes he should do that only for shipping (like Amazon, USPS, etc.) and that we as a country should begin practicing driving less and using public transport more.

"The average American works about one day per week just to afford a car" is one of the most perplexing and saddest facts I have heard within this lecture. Cars are not only a damaging factor towards our environment, but a damaging factor towards our own income and our livelihood. I believe right now we are in a sticky situation where the removal of cars can harm the amount of jobs out there for people to take, especially since we are in the age of Uber and Lyft. I, for one, agree that we need to start going towards the age of bus, subway, and train transportation, but the taxi business will be a huge opponent for us if we want to stray away from the automobile industry. The reason as to why I am bringing this up is because of the fact that Uber and Lyft has created a huge business with the taxi service and creating hundreds of new jobs that people, like my own mother, can take. Seeing how my mother has to pay off the car in order to actually work and keep her job, Ken is hitting it close to home with how much we dedicate our time and money just to have a car and be able to work.
<br><br>
Even though I want to stray away from automobiles, the fact that Uber, Lyft, Doordash, etc. businesses are now booming within the age of technology, it is going to be difficult to change this technological culture that already has many of us relying on it for jobs and mode of transportation. Especially since the taxi and automobile industry are having very close connections in the amount of cars are being placed on the highways. If we can somehow find ways to stop the taxi and automobile industries, or at least make them less "cool", and support different modes of transportation, then I can fully believe we can change the minds of many Americans of the idea that you do not need a car in order to be successful in life.

I was shocked to hear that statistic as well, because it truly put into perspective how much time and effort we expend in order to achieve a societal norm. When I reflect on my personal life, I possessed several opportunities and the accessibility to choose public transportation, but I wanted to feel the status effects of having a car. As Ken highlighted in the video, manufacturing a car already places your individual carbon footprint at, or above, two metric tons of carbon dioxide. That is insane, as most teenagers have tunnel vision regarding buying their first car and strive to acquire it as soon as possible. Owning a vehicle is a powerful social symbol that communicates your position on the totem pole. Additionally, I appreciate your acknowledgment of the currently booming Lyft and Uber industry and how that causes conflicts in progressing towards a more sustainable future. I think that with any technological innovation, adequate amount of public support and advertisement is required to trigger a monumental shift. As disheartening as it is, advertising is a major attracting force that controls the deliberate and unconscious behaviors of many Americans. Whether we realize it or not, we fall into consumer culture traps, where as you touched on, determines what is considered "cool"; in other words, what practices we flaunt or neglect.
<br><hr>
I agree with you that automobiles are less favorable than public transportations. And I also agree that they need to be “less cool”. Calling cabs instead of taking buses is just another form of consumerism. When I hang out with my friends I wouldn’t say “oh let's take the bus” because that is equivalent to saying: “yeah I am broke”. I do not want to feel embarrassed but that is just a thing in our culture right now. You don’t get to show your success and fortune if you live in a minimalist way. If minimalism becomes a thing like gay marriage people would respect our decisions and we will feel less embarrassed to say “let's take the bus”. In addition, I was shocked when Ken said that electric cars emit about 50% more CO2 than an ordinary car.  I used to think that electric cars are environment-friendly but if they cause more problem then we should really switch to public transportation as soon as possible. I stopped driving my own car for like almost half a year and I do not feel any problem with that.


<br><hr>
This may be a weird analogy or something that may not even be possible but hear me out. Ken said that cars live an average of 11 years before we buy another one, or they break down, or both. If we think of cars as water containers or some object of the like, then a single-use plastic is a lot worse off then a metal or harder plastic container that is reusable. Individuals can reuse a plastic water bottle for only so long before it starts to break and be unusable. That is where metal, reusable, water bottles come in to play. If an object has the ability to be used over and over again for years, if not decades without it breaking or being unable to carry out its function, then there would be a lot less waste. How does this relate to cars? Well, my main point is that if we just focus on how to create a car that can run for a lot longer than the average 11 years or even learn how to fix cars so they can run a lifetime then the number of emissions created from creating new cars could be lowered and people that want them could still have their cars. I guess what I am attempting to say is that yes, instead of using a uber or lyft an individual should use some form of public transportation. But if an individual wants to use a car, then, for the first couple years they would be paying it off but then once after that, if it lasts a lot longer or you know how to fix it then it can last a lifetime. I personally know an individual that has a car dating back from the 60’s.


<br><hr>
I was also very startled to hear that quote about just how much we as Americans spend on our cars. It makes the idea of living without a car, at least in theory, sound very appealing. Not only could you save tens of thousands of dollars across your lifetime, but you could immensely reduce your carbon footprint.

<br><Br>
However, like you pointed out, a swift and comprehensive shift away from our dependence on personal automobiles is virtually impossible. Many people depend on their cars in order to make a living, and culturally we as Americans care far to much about our cars to just give them up. 
<br><br>

But in order to stay within our climate change goal, as it was proposed at the Paris Climate Accord, we not only need to change our countries relationship with transportation, we need to be role models for the rest of the world. Otherwise, and this was perhaps what I found most concerning from Ken’s lecture, the rest of the world will adopt the same desires and addiction to automotive that we’ve benefited from for many decades.
<br><hr>
I agree that it will be difficult to change this technological culture of ours. We have become reliable on the automobile industry and as you stated, many people have already adapted to the mode of transportation. It will be difficult to stop the overuse of cars on the roads because people are now creating jobs out of providing transportation for others using their personal vehicles. We continue to see businesses grow that require a personal vehicle. It is sad to say that now, from personal experience, some jobs and volunteer locations require that you have a car so that might be another important factor that would have to be addressed. The use of personal vehicles has been helping businesses grow and create jobs  and as i learned, is seen as a "necessity" today.


<br><hr>
Watching Ken’s videos always make me feel bummed in an educational type of way. I was also saddened when Ken said that “The average American works about one day per week just to afford a car.” Cars affect our lives in a multitude of ways. It’s awful for our environment from the get go for the whole products life. Just one manufactured car being made is equivalent to releasing 2 metric tons of CO2. This is the maximum amount of emissions we can contribute on a yearly basis. And yet so many people have cars, some more than they need, when they could be living great without it. But sadly businesses sell cars as a way for people to have freedom, when in reality it’s actually taking away our freedom in a sense. I love that you bring up transportation services like Uber and Lyft. I think they have their pros and cons for sure. It’s a great option for people who don’t have cars but have to go somewhere inaccessible by public transportation or are intoxicated and would rather be in a car and not on a public bus. It would be great if we could fade out the automobile industry by getting rid of personal cars but still allow things like Uber and Lyft while we upgrade the public transportation system. But something that needs to change is the price. We need to make public transportation free if we want people to consider taking it over owning a car which is constantly costing money for gas and upkeep. 
<br><br>
I had learned in class prior about how electric cars aren’t all they’re cracked up to be. But something I learned from Ken’s video was how fuel efficient public transportation is. The fact that you can go hundreds of miles from one gallon of gas is incredible, I had no clue! I was never a big fan of using the train to go back home because it takes double the time, but now I only want to take the train home and back because of how beneficial it is. I really hope we can make the changes necessary to make public transportation the main way of transport soon. I feel as though in order to do so we must do it politically by using grant money to upgrade public transportation and make laws to fade out automobiles. It’ll be a bumpy road to get there, but it’ll be worth it.
<br><hr>
When I watched Ken’s lecture, I was shocked that the average American would work an entire day just to pay off their car. Ken talks about how if this money was instead invested into retirement, Americans could retire in their late 40’s instead of at 65. In my opinion, allowing people to understand just how much freedom they can take from not purchasing a car is something we need to teach. We need to teach this sort of thing in public school, reiterating to our children that cars are a terrible investment for both the globe and our own bank accounts. Although I like many love to drive, I think moving towards buses and subways is a great idea. However, I think one of the biggest problems with subways and buses is they are gross. Often they are crammed, smell bad, and can even be unsafe. It’s much more relaxing to drive than to deal with public transportation, and I think that's why so many Americans choose to drive. With respect to the comments on Ubers and Lyfts, I think that those companies could definitely shift their focus into buses and other infrastructure that benefits the planet. Any change to our planet will create some job loss, but in the long run, we will create so many more jobs. I think that individuals need to focus on reducing their car use before we begin to target businesses like uber or Doordash.
<br><hr>

I agree that being in the era we are now, it is difficult to view change in our already set modes of living. I also found it very true that people spend so much of their income on their cars whether it be maintenance or a car wash, that it becomes a burden to keep up with all these extra expenditures. I grew up in a very small, rural town in the Central Valley. I never had to commute through bus, and coming to UCSB has forced me to begin using this type of transportation. Once I began traveling by bus, I thought of how efficient and cheap it is to just hop on the bus to get to where you need to go. A lot of the time people think riding the bus is “gross” or “dirty,” but for every day commuting, it has been the most efficient on my end. You don’t have to worry about parking or paying for parking, you can use the extra walking as exercise, and so much more…. There is really no downside to this! However, I do get that many people of “higher” status or wealth do not take the bus due to it being uncool or unnecessary. 
<br><br>
The reference to Ken’s past student saying we just need riding the bus to become cool, and driving cars to be uncool is very true. Today, people are so influenced by what is in style and out of style that there is a default constant need for more of everything imaginable. Consumerism skyrockets every year, and the accumulation of unnecessary items becomes a normality. We literally have more cars than licensed drivers in the United States because cars are “cool.” Americans take such pride in being a nation full of freedom and luxury that we are ultimately harming our planet in the worst way possible. Mass transportation simply cannot compete with the car, and like Ken states, receives less funding than automobile companies. What is considered “cool” in this world is what will be the detriment of sustainability and longevity of the earth.
<br><hr>
When I began to write my response to this video I did not even begin to think about the companies such as Uber, Lyft, and door-dash etc. This is a great thing to point out when talking about how much of a problem we have on our hands. Ken is right, we are facing a serious cultural problem and its going to be very hard to fix it because of multiple factors. I would say the biggest factors would be the effect that cars have on the economy and the conveniency that they provide. So many people depend on their automobile for their job, especially today where technology and the automobile come together to provide services like door-dash and Lyft. Because so many people need a car for their job it is going to be hard to convince people to get rid of their car. In addition to this a lot of people live in the suburbs and need a car to commute to work and or get around the area. If public transportation became more widespread, efficient and available this would be very influential and helpful In getting rid of cars. however, Its going to take more than just the effort of riding transportation. We need to vote to create legislation that gets rid of cars and devotes more federal money towards public transportation. 
<br><br>
In addition to this it is going to be hard to change the way society feels about cars because of how used we are to driving them. It seems ridiculous to go from a more convenient method back to a known less convenient method. This is like asking people to choose to do something the long way when the short cut is available. However, this needs to be done. I think it is important that this is done relatively soon so that the next generation grows up without cars and never gets used to these destructive habits that we are all so used to indulging in.

The facts that Ken provided in this lecture video really caught me off guard because I never really looked at cars this way. I find it astonishing that traffic incidents are the leading causes of death for people over ten, yet this really shouldn't be surprising. I find it ironic that we are afraid of other epidemics like disease (which we should be) yet we are not afraid of cars. Think about that.
  <br><hr>
  Nowadays almost everyone has a car, if not more than one car. I think it's going to be really hard to make the transition to public transportation, but it has to be done. Personally, I try to use the bus or train as much as possible, but it is so much more convenient to just get somewhere by car. It is faster by a lot and just much more comfortable, but I just think that's a sacrifice that needs to be made because of how dependent we have become on cars.

<br><Br>
However, I do think that although rideshare companies are making it harder to make this transition, I can see the upsides of using uber or lyft pool or just sharing with friends as opposed to driving by yourself. Carpooling seems like a better option than just simply driving by yourself. It would save a lot of gas and maybe even money. I do hope we find a way to stop the automobile industry from growing so rapidly, so we can promote the use of public transportation.
<Br><hr>

I was also very surprised to hear this statistic. It is shocking to think that that much of our time and energy goes towards owning a car. I agree that while this is a very sad fact, it will be incredibly difficult to change this so that owning a car is no longer desired or seen as "cool." Even in my own life, I constantly choose cars, including Ubers, instead of taking public transportation. This is not necessarily because driving a car is seen as cooler, but usually it is simply because of the convenience factor that comes with cars. The United States public transportation system is very poor compared to many other countries, especially if you do not live in a city as mentioned in this video. I feel like many people that live in America would not be able to go anywhere without having their own car, including their jobs. I am from a very small town, and I know countless people, including my parents, that have to drive out of town in order to get to work, and there is no form of public transportation that would be able to get them there. The first step that we need to take in order for people to stop using cars is to create a much more efficient public transportation system.
<br><hr>
I found the fact that “the average American works about one day per week just to afford a car” interesting, but I do not agree that it is perplexing at all. It seems pretty clear that many people need cars in our current state. Our public transportation system and suburban sprawl has made cars a necessity to go to work and get around. As Ken mentioned, living in the city prevents much of this, but not everyone can fit into the cities, and as a result, some must rely on cars.
<br><Br>
I do not this this is a great situation to be in. More resources should be invested into public transportation to make it a viable option, which in turn will reduce or eliminate many people’s reliance on personal cars. I don’t believe the taxi business will be an opponent at that point. Public transportation would be much cheaper than a personal taxi, Lyft, or Uber. 
<br><Br>
I think making buses and other forms of non-car transportation appear “cool” is not necessary, but will greatly benefit the process of moving away from cars. Once public transportation is accessible, reliable, and cheap enough, many will naturally stray away from cars. The “coolness” factor would be a great catalyst to start that trend, creating a positive feedback loop of investment, progress, and further support.
<br><hr>

I was just as upset to hear that statistic as well. The fact that it takes nine thousand dollars a year to maintain a car was very shocking to hear. I literally could not believe that that was accurate. The sad part as well was to hear that that despite the fact that cars will never be environmentally friendly and are very popular. I also instantly thought about how Uber, Lyft, and doordash etc. are such  a part of people's lives now, and how hopeless that makes me feel. I just got a car and instantly you see the shift in your bank account. Hearing all of this made me feel trapped and not wanting a car anymore. Ken's lecture video was super impactful, and I appreciate how we reminds us of how much of our carbon footprint can be reduced. He said that if we do make the switch to buses, subways, and trains our footprint is reduced by a factor of 14. 
<br><br>
Like Ken and you mentioned, changing the narrative of taking the bus, train or subway are not "cool" is going to be difficult but the fact that we can take a look at the way culture works within Humanities makes me feel a little better. If we can change the narrative, and destroy the fact that buses, subways, and trains are signify not being "cool" for whatever the reasons may be, and find those reasons will really make a change. The importance of making it known that cars will never be environmentally friendly is a fact that many people need to hear and understand for the sake of the planet.
<br><Hr>
I totally agree with your idea that we are really hard to stay away from the automobiles because the technological culture that already has many of us relying on it for jobs and transportation.It surprised me that one gallon of petrol per gallon could transport the train to 750 miles. We can save so much money using only public transport, and it ’s very helpful to the environment. 
<br><br>
I think one of the most influential and beneficial things we have to do is to work hard to popularize public transportation, because it can not only reduce Americans’ Emissions, and can reduce emissions throughout the world.
    
  <br><Hr>
  I agree that it’ll be very difficult to even slightly dismantle the automobile industry with the growing reliance on Uber/Lyft in our society. Something I’ve noticed that is a commonly associated mindset with public transportation is that using it makes you lower-class or even “dirty.” This type of mindset has turned people off from public transportation in favor of cars, something that Ken explains when he talks about how the automobile industry has worked hard to appeal to consumers and associate having cars with being cool. Additionally, there are people who don’t want to use public transportation simply because it usually doesn’t take them to their direct destination. It’s a bit upsetting that some would rather increase their carbon emissions instead of taking 10 minutes to walk to their destination from the bus stop.
<br><br>
I really wish more resources would be allocated to public transportation. When I think further about it, it’s even odd how attached we are to our cars aside from the apparent convenience. It will take an enormous amount of effort, but I also want to be optimistic that we’ll be able to slowly change people’s minds about cars.
    <br><Hr>
  I completely agree with you statement, I myself am found guilty of using these type of transportation services. Whenever I travel, I always try to find a cheaper solution to get around such as using the bus or carpooling with some friends, using the train, and so on. However I often find myself using services like uber and Lyft when I don't feel like taking the bus or when I am running late toward somewhere I need to be. Especially with our youth in today's society, it sill be extremely difficult for them to steer away from these services. As the years progress I feel that these services are just going to gain more popularity and more people will rely on them as a means of transportation, a sad reality. I had the same reaction of the mention how the average American working about one day per week just to afford a car, I have a coworker who was literally telling me how he was picking up more hours so that these upcoming months he can buy a car.
    <br><Hr>
This was one of the most striking facts to me as well. I decided right then and there that when I have my own family, we are owning one car, max. I like how Ken touched on the incredible irony of it all: that we view cars as freedom, and yet they literally control large portions of our economy, culture, personal finances, and  planet. I've got to hand it to the advertisers: they really new what they were doing in order to sell us expensive death traps. 
<br><br>
I totally agree with you, mass transit is the only viable solution. I would however like to mention that Lyft, Uber, and even just regular taxis may actually be helping in some ways. Instead of people buying their own cars, and thus emitting all that carbon it takes to manufacture and maintain one, they are sharing vehicles. This points to a strange yet true fact about cars:  for most people, our most valuable possessions, other than our homes, are not in use the majority of the day (at least I hope that's the case because long commutes are emotionally draining). This is seriously something we need to correct, the fact that we buy things to sit in our driveways for most of their life time is ridiculous.
    <br><Hr>
I also strongly believe that people do not necessarily need to have a car in their daily life. For example, in New York, a lot of people choose to take buses or subways to go to work. Those people also enjoy their life and it works pretty well. I think that the problem is that some people have an idea that having a luxury car can show his wealth and social status, so some of them spend most of their expenditure on a luxury car. I belive that this is a wrong idea. People will respect you if you work hard and have a great value toward your life. People might need to  pursue those that is "truly" valuable to them. Besides, it is kind of disappointing that still lots of people do not realize the devastated effects to the environment from cars. Once we realize it, we ought to change our lifestyle in order to have a better life in the future.

According to Ken, Transportation accounts for a quarter of the CO2 emissions. Therefore, it is necessary to change people's transportation ways. It is important to hold the average person CO2 emission less than 2 metric tons every year which can keep the global temperature rising below 2 degrees celsius. However, the production of a typical car will emit about 17 metric tons of CO2. Furthermore, the production of an SUV or a range rover will produce 35 metric tons of CO2 to the atmosphere. Hence, if a person just buys a car, he will have used about his 11 years CO2 allotment as the average CO2 emission of producing cars is 22 metric tons. Although producing an electric car will emit more CO2 than producing a typical car, an electric car will emit much less CO2 by just consuming electricity compared with a typical car that burns fossil fuel. Even though electric cars will contribute less to the climate crisis, it is not enough to mitigate the climate crisis. In fact, the climate crisis can not be mitigated by just using technology. If we intend to eradicate the problem, we have to change our culture. For example, consumerism should not be advocated.
<br><Br>
     It is possible to travel 35 miles, 50 miles, and even 75 miles by just burning one gallon fossil fuel. The transportations are bus, subway, and train. A survey shows that people in cities tend to go to work by walking or mass transportation. On the other hands, people in suburb tend to buy cars and go out by driving cars. The culture might be influenced by the industries which manufacture cars after WWII. They utilized propaganda to make people believe that owning cars will benefit them a lot. Owning a car may seem like that it brings a more convenient life, but maintaining the car will cost lots of money. People will spend 9000 dollars a year to keep a car. People can retire early at about 50-year-old if they choose to travel by public transportation. In my perspective, it is a quite appealing way which both cuts my CO2 footprint and makes me have lots of time to do something else.

I found this video extremely interesting for many reasons. For one, I've always thought owning an electric car was somewhat of a one fix problem. I thought if everyone just bought Teslas that it would change the world. I realize now after the points Ken made that I was wrong. I found the proposal of taking mass transit more often, such as buses and trains, incredibly interesting. Growing up in the Inland Empire, my experience with mass transit was non existent. I have actually never taken a bus before until arriving to UCSB. I think this relates back to the idea mentioned in the video that mass transit isn't considered cool. In high school, it seemed like a competition to who would get their drivers license first and who could drive to school. Frankly I've never heard anyone say, "oh you bus to school, that so cool!" In my city, the bus system was little too non existent. There were bus stops here and there but driving around my city you would be rare to see a bus on the street. I find that the lack of infrastructure makes this possible. Friends of mine would only take the bus if they lived in another city and weren't old enough to drive yet, only to drive to school once they got their license. The bus system was just not reliable and inconvenient. Project this idea onto a larger scale and I find that this is why many people prefer to drive. For example, driving back home to the LA area would normally take me about 2 hours without traffic. It would take me about 4 hours by train and on top of that, I would have to drive a little from the train station, and pay an extra $20. I find that examples like this just make it not worth it for many to take that option. Developments like the bullet train and better infrastructure in general need to be created asap if we want mass transit to become cool. To many people, although they may want to do their part in reducing climate change, its simply not worth it/cool enough to spend extra time, money, and convenience to take mass transit the way it currently is. Cities must gather more funding if they want to get people away from their cars and more into taking mass transit if they wish for this solution Ken proposed to come true.

I too had never taken a bus or really any form of public transportation until I came to UCSB. However, at home, the commutes I made did not have bus routes that would efficiently cover these distances. It was impractical to take the bus to and from school or any other destination I had to go. If there had been, I would not have been opposed to it, but driving was sort of a goal or a big aspect of high school. If we create more accessible means of public transit then perhaps we could transition from a culture of driving and emitting gases, to one of more shared transit that would reduce our impact on the environment. These transit systems need to be streamlined though in order to create incentive to take them rather than just driving yourself directly to your destination. If public transit had benefits other than reducing our emissions then seeing a transition in our way of lives towards public transit would be much more likely.

This video makes me realize that solving the climate problems of cars by technology development is impractical currently. Even just purchasing a car can fulfill the limitation of individual's carbon footprint per year. Therefore, the problems of cars should be solved in another way as a cultural problem. We need to know why almost everyone is addicted to cars. Personally speaking, I am not fascinated by cars, but purchasing a car is the main trend in society. Many people think the car is the symbol of their status. Thus, the car becomes a standard to tell a person wealthy or not. In my home country, the ownership of houses and cars is the basic standard to marry, since the female side can know your wealth through this way. We can not deny that in this world with "equality", everyone wants to be superior to others. So, the climate crisis is a cultural problem. If we can all do everything like the "Minimalism", the climate crisis will be much easier. However, once the culture was set, it is hard to change. We can not suddenly let everyone realize the car is less efficient than public transportations, so use more public transportation. What we can do is to try to influence the people around.

I also believe that technology is not the solution that we need. Technology is not the answer and it cannot save us from the climate crisis. While it is true that technological advancements can help us reduce our carbon emissions by creating more efficient products, we need to do more as a society. Technology can only do so much to help mitigate the problem but not solve it. We cannot sit around and rely on technology to solve the problems that we have created ourselves. 
<br><br>
Regarding the statistics about the creation of a car, I was shocked to learn just how much emissions are released from its production. By simply purchasing a car, you have already added a bunch of carbon emission to your footprint. In today's day and age luxury and sports cars have become synonymous with wealth and status. People have the mentality that they need to own a bunch of  material possessions to be seen as successful. This is probably why there are people out there who refuse to use mass transit or public transportation such as buses. They believe that taking the bus is for ‘poor’ people or people who can’t afford a car so they refuse to use it. Unless we change the ‘stigma’ around using public transportation, people will always look to cars as the first choice of transportation.

While I watched this lecture, I found myself reflecting on when I was a young girl. From a very young age, I fantasized about being able to drive a car of my own. When my parents drove me around, it merely felt like a mode of transportation, being logistically synonymous to a train or bus. However, when I viewed myself driving, I saw it as a symbol of freedom and status, or as Ken’s lecture describes, it is seen as a symbol of being “cool.” It was so intriguing to hear about the tangible ways that this image was placed into my brain for the sake of American consumerism, dating back to an effort to spur the post-war economy. I find that I am constantly being made aware of the ways that I have previously thought I myself to have free will and a free command of my desires, only to have those thoughts shattered by the deliberate and traceable conditioning of the society that has shaped me. I find this thought to be terrifying, as I wonder if any of my actions or even my thoughts are created solely by the inner workings of my brain, independent of any outside influences. However, dwelling on this thought will do me no good and I am making an effort to settle with the knowledge that I am influenced by far more than I am aware of.

I agree with you that having a license and your own car is a freedom that so many of us have dreamed of when we were growing up. I never even realized that this “freedom” that we imagined was put on us by society. This is a part of the consumer culture that we buy into without even realizing it. Although I personally still don’t have my license or a car, I still dream of that “freedom” that everyone talks about. I see it as something that makes me more independent, but I have now realized that the only reason I want that is because it is hard to get around back home without having a car. Here, I feel like my own person and independent because I have a way of getting around without driving. 
<br><br>
One of the facts that extremely surprised me from Ken’s lecture is that it takes $9,000 a year to own a car. I always knew that having a car was a bit expensive, but never this much. I can’t imagine all the money people would save if they didn’t have a car and instead just relied on public transportation. In my own family, each person has a car beside me; the amount of CO2 released into the air just by family is insane. I think that our communities should focus more on relying on public transportation as a means of getting around. This would immensely help during the climate crisis because so many people would not be driving a car, but instead using buses/trains and not adding as much to the gases released into the atmosphere.
   <br><hr>
   The statistics on just how detrimental car use is to the environment are shocking. Prior to this lecture, I had no idea that a single car produces 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, not including any other point source pollutants, and was shocked to discover that electric cars produce roughly half that amount as electric cars are typically advertised to be the zero-emission fix to the issues brought about by fossil fuel dependent cars.

<br><br>
Being a Southern California native, specifically from the Inland Empire, the normalization of extreme commuting for work and a lack of adequate public transportation systems make car culture a big part of most people's everyday lives. In my school district and many surrounding districts, school buses were only ever used for field trips, not transporting kids to and from school on a daily basis. Additionally, where I'm from is considered to be an outskirt Los Angeles suburb with little to no employment opportunities. Thus, many of my friends' parents spent 1-2 hours commuting to  LA for work and back every single day.  Further, not being in a major city like Santa Barbara or Los Angeles, meant that the public transportation in my city was subpar and the number of hills and distances between places made biking or walking unreasonable. Suburbia inspires car culture because almost nothing is conveniently located near where clumps of neighborhoods tend to be. Coming to Santa Barbara, the active culture and availability of public transportation has encouraged me to bike, take the bus, or rideshare wherever I need to go.

One of the reasons that makes me want to live in suburbs the least is that it would require me to have a car. Driving is just really unappealing to me personally because both the amount of time you would have to spend to drive, and the stress that comes from having to deal with traffic (I personally saw what a two way 2 hour commute did to my father’s state of mind over the years). But the main point that I actually want to make is point about needing a car. Ken is definitely right in that goal needs to be to get Americans (and hopefully then the rest of the world) to think that cars aren’t “cool” anymore, but that sounds to me like more of an end goal. The short term necessity to reach this end term goal however is to get more people to ride busses, trains and subways at the present. The way I see it is though is there is no way that this is going to happen unless these other options are actually viable alternatives (the train industry in this country being the most extreme example of how unviable some of these options are). It was as Ken said in the video, in part because of the government working with car industries and defunding public transport that was one of the reasons that led to the widespread American adoption of the car, therefore, I’d argue that once other better transportation options pop up for people other can cars sheer logistics can get (at least non diehard car lovers) to give up their expensive cars for more convenient alternatives.

It's really irritating that cars are so essential to life, especially due to the anxiety and anger that cars and traffic invoke. Public transportation tech exists and it's amazing, but it's not accessible enough to working class Americans! This is because of the huge part of the economy dedicated to suburbia and having a car. Taking the bus sometimes takes 2+ hours, and people who work to put food on the table cannot afford that loss of time, but cannot afford a car either.
<br><br>
I think that the used car industry actually has a fair amount of merit. Buying new cars boosts demand and the industry, but buying used cars takes yourself out of the production loop. It is time to shift our focus from creating new technology to making our current technology more accessible, affordable, and efficient. The jobs that are lost in the new car industry can be repurposed to the public transportation industry. This will also help control anxiety among the populace and boost community.

A combination of technological advancements and cultural change will help us save the planet. Cultural change will be a very challenging thing to accomplishment. The idea of it being desirable to have many material items and to live in a large house is a societal creation. But, we have the power to create a new normal. A new normal in which people live in micro apartments in the city, practice minimalism, eat a vegan diet, and use public transportation. Everyone can put in effort in changing our culture. For instance, restaurant owners can switch their menus to being vegan and marketing can help influence people to become more environmentally friendly. Every job has the power to have an environmental protection objective at its core. 
<br><br>
I think that transportation will be a very difficult thing for people to support. Traveling to distant places is something that everyone desires. Similarly, with cars and planes being faster and more convenient, it makes sense why people would opt these forms of transportation. We definitely need to become a slower placed society in which people aren't trying to cram in everything into their schedule. By having a more open schedule, people will be able to use this extra time in a more conscious way.

The most surprising fact for me in this lecture was that just manufacturing a car emitted so much carbon. I hadn't even considered that when taking cars into account, frankly. To know that an unused car in a basement was "equivalent to releasing 2 metric tons of carbon dioxide" was alarming. I'm a little bit on the fence on this aspect of the climate crisis. Even though I know that cars account for a quarter of the average American's carbon footprint and know that America and Europe had a big hand in popularizing car usage around the world, I've experienced first-hand the convenience it provides. Coming from a suburban area, I've made use of both public transportation and cars and can say with certainty that life is easier with a car. Yet, cars have no future in preventing the climate crisis. Out of all of the lifestyle change that Ken recommended in his past videos, I think this one will be the one I will personally struggle with the most.

Although I do wish to reduce my carbon footprint after learning of the harms that the things we do cause, I agree with you in full about the struggles of this particular issue. I knew that the car/transportation industry was a major perpetrator in the climate crisis, but I too, had no idea how terrible cars are for the environment. I use my car almost every single day and have on my own for three years in order to complete tasks I consider necessary to my life. Perhaps changing my definition of ‘necessary’ would allow me to really think about giving up my vehicle, but as of now, I don’t think I’ll be able to cut out this part of my life. After learning of the extent of the carbon emission that the meat industry creates, I have actually cut down my consumption of meat by at least three quarters. I know that many people claim to be influenced by the information provided by Ken about the climate crisis, but I feel that this can really only be true if they have made some sort of change for the better. I know that the few changes I have made may not be making a great difference, and I wish that I could get behind the idea of living without a car, but for now, I feel that the few changes I’ve made are at least helping the escalating crisis a little bit. Maybe in the future when I’m out of college, I won’t rely on a car so heavily and will be able to do without one.

<br><hr>
I am very surprised by the amount of carbon emitted when manufacturing a car. It is alarming. I am very interested to see viable alternatives to cars or other forms of ecofriendly more efficient forms of public transportation because at the moment cars are far more convenient. I had no idea that cars account for more than a quarter of the carbon footprint. If electric cars don't work, and gas cars don't work for the environment, what would be the alternative to these things to be able to maintain an adequate life? I will keep this information in mind when I am out of college and am ready to purchase a vehicle as well.

<br><hr>
I agree with your point on the convenience of the car. In suburban areas, cars are necessary to get anywhere and my mom worked three hours away from her job so I know she wouldn’t have been able to get there without a car. Of course, she could have moved closer but she loved being where she is because it’s where her parents and the rest of her family is. Even in bigger places like Santa Barbara, it can be convenient to have a car. People like cars because they don’t need to wait for public transportation and if they have bigger items they need to bring home they can just stick it in their car instead of having to carry those big items on the bus.

<br><br>
I’m not trying to say we shouldn’t try to reduce our usage and buying of cars, I’m just stating why it may be difficult to convince people to reduce this usage. I’m sure with how many climate activists are rising in numbers each year that the usage of cars will reduce with each year also. Unfortunately, I’m just not entirely positive we can get everyone in the world, especially Americans, to go without cars.
<br><hr>
This news that manufacturing a car can release a lot of carbon dioxide also surprised me. I used to know that driving a car can produce a lot of air pollution, but I ignored that the process of producing cars can also produce pollution. The best way to reduce the pollution caused by the car business is to reduce the consumption of cars. However I find it is almost impossible. There are too many factors preventing us not to consume cars. First of all, the public transportation is not convenient. Sometimes, taking the bus can take more time up to 1 hour than driving a car by oneself. So many people are not willing to take the bus due to the waste of time. Another reason is that the taxi business. The price of taking Uber and Lyft is high, it is expensive to take them for a long time. Under this situation, many people would choose to buy a car instead of taking a taxi. Although the government is appealing the public to take public transportation, they are not good at providing a good reason to the public to choose public transportation instead of private cars. So it is sad that we are unable to stop car business and the effect they brought to the earth.


<br><hr>
I agree with your opinion that cars are very convenient, and I too believe that this is one aspect of the climate crisis that I struggle with the most. As much as I want to fight the climate crisis, I am not entirely sure how we encourage the use of public transportation unless there is structural change in our cities. I believe we must make a change but this needs to be done in steps, as people all over the world will lose their jobs if we cut off the car industry. Ken mentioned that at one point, 1/6 of people were employed (directly and indirectly) by the car industry. This in of itself presents challenges. I was also surprised to hear about the amount of CO2 it takes to manufacture cars, even those considered “zero emissions”. Ken discussed how ideally, each of us should not be producing more than 2 metric tons of CO2 and yet, simply having a car in the garage takes up that amount. I think it is good to keep all of this in mind, even if we cannot solely use public transportation currently. 
<br><br> 
I believe that as a UCSB student, we do a great job at keeping our carbon emissions low and biking around. If we could somehow do this more in our own towns, it would make such a difference. This summer I will be working in Downtown Los Angeles and instead of driving over 2 hours every day, I have decided to use public transportation. Not only does this reduce the stress of city driving for me, but it helps me lessen my carbon footprint. This class, and this lecture, has motivated me to take this perspective and share it with others. Knowing that traffic accidents are a leading cause of death for so many people and that cars harm our planet, we cannot be complacent with our daily environmental choices.
<br><hr>
I too was super surprised about how manufacturing a car adds so much carbon into the atmosphere. I think that I’ve always thought more about how carbon emissions occur due to the driving of a car rather than the carbon footprint of its original production, which is why it never really occurred to me that we should just stop the production of all cars as a whole. But, now that Ken has brought it up, it really does seem like a viable option to just try to stop car production and instead focus on more “green” ways to get around, like using bikes, public transportation, or simply walking.

But I also agree that it will be hard for people to stop using cars all together. America especially has a very obvious “car” culture- it is a rite of passage when you turn 16 to get your driver's license and maybe your first car.  People love their cars;  they dress them up with reindeer ears during the holiday season and many even name their cars. How are these people going to be convinced to give up their beloved vehicles? How are future car buyers going to be convinced that they shouldn’t buy a car at all? This sounds like a very large project to commit to, and, although it would greatly reduce our carbon emissions and could be implemented fairly well into our cities, this plan may not work in rural areas and people will have a hard time parting with one of their “freedoms”.
<br><Br>
I also didn’t know that cars are one of the most unrecycle-able products on the market. It seems like cars could be recycled, but at the same time, what would the scrap metal be used for after, let’s say, a car gets into a crash and is totalled. Everything will get dumped and not much, if anything, would be reused. It was really worrisome to think about the fact that we have spent so much time  trying to make and perfect electric cars when we really should've been focusing on what to do to stop the production of cars as a whole.

It is indeed terrifying that buying a new car has already released two metric tons of CO2 even though we do not use it. Even the so-called environmental-friendly car like Tesla has already caused damage to environment during its production process. Thus, professor Ken raised a significant point that technological advancement is not an effective approach to solve environmental problems and the only way for us to address the climate crisis is to change our life style, or culture. For example, use public transportation as much as possible instead of buying cars and driving everyday.

After listening to Ken’s lecture I too am appalled with consumer culture and how much CO2 is released into the atmosphere as a result of transportation. We as a society have been convinced that we all need a personal car and to think that electric cars are the solution to the future but listening to this lecture has opened my eyes as well. A total overhaul of the current transportation system will need to be put in place, as the amount of cars on the road is terrifying. Recreating the transportation is necessary at this point. We can see it within places such as Copenhagen and Japan who rely solely on public transportation systems, that they have already successfully transitioned to fewer cars. As they took away resources from roads and put them towards updated transportation systems, they have ultimately reduced their carbon footprint from mass amounts of cars on the roads proving this to be an effective strategy in combating the climate crisis.

I found this lecture quite interesting, but I couldn't help but feel guilty by the end. Ever since I got my license most of the time me and my friends just go drive around without any knowledge of the long term effects of our trip. Learning all the statistics that were mentioned throughout the video, I am convinced that if I truly need a car it should be an electric car. I had no idea that taking cars out of our lives would be so much better for the environment and that we would still be able to get from place to place by train, buses, or the subway. These alternatives are much less expensive than having a car of your own, because of the monthly payment of the car, the gas costs, insurance, and other maintenance things like oil changes and washes that you are avoiding by taking public transportation. While some may argue that having your own car is less stressful because you can leave whenever, there is the stress of making sure that your car has gas and can get from point a to point b. Financially public transportation seems like the better option.
<br><br>
While it is ideal that we all get rid of our cars and use other modes of transportation that release less carbon, I don’t see all of America giving up their cars all of a sudden. There will always be people that prefer their car over the bus, so I feel like we shouldn’t give up on technological advances of cars and trying to get a car with zero emissions. I believe that in the future as more of the population becomes aware of the consequence of their cars and how much better for the environment, as well as them financially, not having a car is the number of cars on the road will significantly decrease and the only cars on the road will be electric cars.

I agree with all of the points in your comment. I was also surprised by the staggering effects that a single person driving a car has on the environment as well as the statistics about the cost of an average American to own a car. I also agree with the statement that public transportation is simply a better solution financially. The amount of money spent on the maintenance and gas for a car is insanely high, factor in the costs of insurance and that amount gets even higher. 
<br><br>
However, while it is environmentally and financially the better solution, public transportation is sadly not the most practical at times. As Ken has referenced before, time is a very valuable concept to the average American. The fact that it can take up to forty minutes to get from UCSB to downtown Santa Barbara by Bus and only 20 minutes by car demonstrates this point accurately. While it is better for the environment, our self-centered American culture is more concerned about how such changes will affect our own lives. Additionally, public transportation is not accessible in all areas. Areas located deep in the mountains or away from civilization are sometimes only accessible by car. In situations like this, cars seem like the only solution.
<br><br>
However, I specifically chose to reply to your comment because of your last point. That we should not give up on cars all of a sudden because most Americans will prefer them to public transportation. I felt that Ken was particularly harsh when discussing the technological advancements of cars over the past couple of decades. While it may be true that we should have focused more on the cultural elements of driving a car, it is impossible to deny the importance that they hold in our modern society. So while it may not make ecological sense to continue developing cars, when you look at society as a whole it becomes clear that they will still be a mainstay for most of the population. This means that we should focus on improving cars in the future because it seems unlikely they will disappear any time soon.

Ken really opened my eyes to electric cars, I never really thought of what goes into making a car, and how much emissions are produced during the production. I have always been told that to help the environment you should ditch your gasoline car, and switch to electric cars. The best thing for the environment would be to use the public transportation within your city, like trains, subways, and buses. Even better one could walk or bike, which is the best for the environment. This lecture got me thinking about all the things that go into creating all the things we own, not just cars. This is what Ken is talking about when he says that the climate crisis is a cultural problem, because of our consumerist society. We are living in a time where the more things we own, the bigger our houses the better we are and the happier we will be. Our society has taught us that our success is defined on all our things, for example celebrities, most of them have so many cars, a giant wardrobe, and huge homes. Everything we own has a carbon footprint, and the bigger and more stuff we have the bigger our own carbon footprint becomes. In order to reverse this idea of consumerism, we need to create a society where riding public transport, like the bus, instead of ones car, and having houses that are just the right size for one and their family, and also getting second hand clothes instead of always going out and buying new ones and throwing away old clothes to be seen as “cool”. This transition will not be easy, and I am not optimistic that our society will ever switch over. Most people love all of their stuff and are not willing to get rid of a lot of it.

I agree with every one of the points you made in this comment 100%. So many of us have heard that so called "gasoline guzzler" cars were the root cause of climate change due to the increased amount of emissions they produced including myself, so I always thought that there was no better alternative than an electric car. My own family ended up buying an electric car for this sole purpose of being our primary way to get around, but the fact of the matter is that it is not truly helping us to reduce our carbon footprint. At the most, it is only a small decline in our footprint compared to other alternative methods of transport such as buses + trains. I do agree with you however that this transition is highly unlikely of actually coming to fruition with the increased participation in consumerism our society has, especially in the recent years. Everywhere you look there's an advertisement for the latest model of a car that just had a brand new model a couple of months ago, and we have even made obtaining a car a sort of tradition that is expected with every passing year for those coming of age or into adulthood. It's sad how our lifestyles have become so entrenched with consumerism and environmentally unfriendly practices. We can only hope that change will come and that society comes to its senses but this cannot happen without actual action.


<br><Hr>
I agree with you in not being too optimistic that our society will be able to make the switch to preferring public transit over personal cars. With such a large number of Americans now living in the suburbs, cars have become almost a necessity for anyone trying to travel around to and from the city or just around their neighborhood. In addition, in our society today, people are much less patient and are always trying to fill every minute of their day, and waiting for the next bus or train is just beyond what some people are willing to do. For some, time is money, and that money comes before the earth.
<br><br>
 I’m not sure how exactly our culture can make public transportation “cool”. But, if the automobile industry was able to heavily advertise to make cars cool after World War II to keep America’s incredible production going, if the government led a campaign to strongly support public transportation, I think the public might be willing to go along with it. However, this would take a coordinated and aggressive advertising movement from the federal government, and it would require an administration that is extremely aware of the impacts of climate change. Moving to solar is already a hard enough switch for our country; imagine the president trying to convince Americans to get rid of their cars. It’s possible, but extremely unlikely. I just can’t see it happening.
<br><Hr>
 I also was not aware of the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted during the manufacturing of zero-emissions vehicles. I like how you were honest about not being optimistic about the transition into a society where material possessions are not highly valued since many people love their “stuff” and will fail to get rid of it. You stated how we must create a society where we grow to love to take the bus and living in houses that are the right size for our family. This is similar to what Ken describes in the video and I wanted to make a small comment based on my experience growing up. I am from Richmond, located in the Bay Area. It is a low income, poverty stricken area. It is around 10 minutes away from Berkeley and about 20 minutes from Oakland. In Richmond, I remember people being teased for riding a bike. People were called “bums” or laughed at for being poor and not having a car if they were even seen on a bike or riding the bus. I barely remember seeing any bike lanes when I was younger. In Berkeley, it is the total opposite. People are applauded for riding their bicycles to work. Hoping on the bus instead of driving is also common and isn’t looked down upon. These are merely my observations and I am not quite sure why this phenomenon takes place. I agree with Ken and it is important to figure out why we as people behave the way we do.

When speaking of motor vechile’s contribution towards Climate Crisis, one of my friends from Beijing has a lot to say about it. It is relatively familiar for everyone how bad pollution was in Beijing. From the pictures we see online, there is not a single square inch of the sky that is not covered by the heavy smog, and the blue sky seems far beyond reach. I once had a conversation with her about it, and she said the pollution was due to heavy traffic in the urban area, industries around the cities, and geographic reasons. Some should even be no stranger to the news that someone made a cube out of smog from the city air. It was not till later Beijing government start enforcing laws to limit the traffic in different “rings” of the city using various methods. 
<br><br>
On the other hand, 2 metric ton / year seems like an extremely challenging goal for middle to upper class family which usually own at least 2 cars and a decent sized property. Like professor had mentioned in the video, consumerism and car culture is part of our history that is written in almost every American’s DNAs. So sudden changes are not going to be easy, and what it takes is a whole generation’s effort. I am glad that a lot of Green movements are blooming in places around California, and I hope it can spread wide across the country. The green culture is our future. Technology is not the solution. Despite newer and possible more eco-friendly technologies are going to surface to the market soon like Hyperloop, and other futuristic transportation systems, we don’t have much time to act on our own choices. In psychology, we learned this interesting concept called Pluralistic ignorance, which means when people thought everyone else was thinking differently from their own opinions, but in fact they share the same ideas. If I put it into practice for fighting climate change, it would phrase some people’s attitude: My actions won’t make any difference. But yes, of course if everyone thinks the same way, nobody is going to do anything. Instead, if we collectively come together and choose to do something, there would be much differences we can change.

Hi! I also think that this is something that will be hard to change so suddenly. I think about my family along with all of my friends families as I was growing up and they all had multiple cars, sometimes more than two. Cars have become something that everyone just has because that is how society has formed us to live. I also liked how you used the example of how our mindsets matter. I have met so many people that have told me "my actions won't matter or won't make a difference", and I also find it so frustrating because you are right if we were to instead collectively come together we could make a difference.
<br><hr>
The city I came from is also troubled with haze problem, especially during winter times. The air pollution is truly a huge problem that requires a solution right now. The car and the industry are major causes of the pollution. Influenced by develop countries and the spreading concept of consumerism, more and more people begin purchase cars, some even own several cars though they don't need that much. It will only make the situation worse. Additionally, this video breaks my previous belief that electric cars is environmental-friendly. I once thought electric cars emit no CO2 so it is good for our climate. However, the truth is just the opposite. I overlook the production process of electric cars actually produce more CO2 into the atmosphere. Thus, instead of depend on new technology to address the problem we made, we should take actions in our daily lives. For example, taking bus or walking when going outside. The public transportation is more effective than private vehicles since it takes more people at the same time, which means the average release of CO2 per person is decreasing. By the way, the psychological term "Pluralistic ignorance" you mentioned is quiet interest for me. I strongly agree with the idea that if everyone waits for other to live differently, no one will actually change. Therefore, let's make something different on ourselves to mitigate the climate change and protect the Earth we live.

This video has helped me a lot on new way of looking at how the usage of cars will bring impacts to our lives. Development of technology has in fact helped us a lot in making our lives so much more convenient than before, especially the cars. I personally understand why people like the use of cars more than using public transportation since it is more comfortable and time-saving and owning cars to some people is a show of their status.
<br><Br>
To be honest, for some places which are not big cities, where lack of enough public transportation, it might need people to drive by themselves, so it is hard to abandon the use of cars. However, if there is a choice to choose between cars and public transportation, choosing public transportation is definitely the one more environmental friendly. 
<br><br>
The way to use of cars, as mentioned in the video, it is not about not using but since some car only carry one person sometime but the numbers of cars on the road are in huge numbers together with the production process of cars which might produce greenhouse gases and toxic chemicals. I hope that not just we need to change our lifestyle but with the growth of technology that we might someday come out with greater method to solve the climate issue. 
<br><br>
But for now, each of us show reflect on the daily things we have been doing and to take a deep look of how human actions are causing climate changes to happen. And cars, which has been mainly mentioned in this video, is the first and basic thing we need to first make changes on in order to reduce harms we put on our environment.

It is interesting how you mentioned the fact that public transportation is not necessarily an option for people who live in suburban areas. If these people wished to take public transportation they would have to walk or bike to catch the bus, for example. Therefore, people decide to purchase a car in order to facilitate their experience and be more time-efficient. So I completely agree with you on the fact that this is one of the leading reasons why people prefer cars over public transportation.

I think the most alarming statistic presented in this lecture was that electric cars emit 48-65% MORE CO2 than producing an average car. Contrary to being advertised and portrayed as zero-emissions and an environmentally friendlier solution to a normal car, it is really not as environmentally friendly as we perceive it to be. As it was mentioned in this lecture, cars themselves will never truly be environmentally friendly. Therefore, it is proposed to turn to buses, subways, trains, etc., in order to decrease our individual carbon emissions in transportation. If we continue our lifestyle of car dependence, the goals of the Paris Accord will never be met, as each person already exhausts their 2 metric ton emission limit on merely buying a car.
<br><br>
The proposal to change to buses, subways, trains is a good idea, as in large metropolises such as New York and Portland in the US, they are already a widespread and common thing. In Asia, they are even more common and convenient, as many households choose to ride public transportation instead of owning their own vehicles. However, there is definitely a difference in the US. Because of the massive landmass, populated areas are spread far apart. Metropolises, where public transportation is the most convenient, only number a few spots in the US out of the giant landmass. And many metropolises do not even implement a public transportation system convenient enough for people to choose buses instead of cars. It is true that the culture of our car dependency needs to change first. Only when we come to terms with it, and decide to stray away from cars, will we actually wean off cars. But even after that, we would need to entirely transform and implement massive changes to public transportation. This would likely take significant time and effort to complete. And the results can only be seen in the long run. Therefore, will lawmakers and city governments actually do it?
<br><Br>
Just like with many other problems, of food, clothing, trend-following, obsessions, it is not easy to change and overwrite the culture that has been built.

I agree with a lot of your first paragraph and see what you are trying to get at with your second paragraph. However, pointing out what Ken explained about shifting the culture to believe "cars are cool" to keep the production industry going after WWII took a lot of work but obviously worked and still thrives today. I visited Washington D.C. this past winter break and like NY and Portland, they have a great transportation system (the metro), that if we had one here in SB I would definitely use often. However, to get to LA weekly and back home in the bay area, I still prefer my car as I have had not-so-great experiences with long public transportation up and down the coast. 
<br><Br>
If we invest in making more efficient, convenient, affordable and accessible public transportation system, that could be across states even, instead of spending on roads and cars, I think cultural change is definitely in reach. 
<br><br>
Given that the car market in China (the leading market) has grown over 10,000% in the last three decades demonstrates the urgency of this cultural change before it widens the gap with public transportation and gets even more difficult to replace. Being a car owner myself, the two biggest problems I have experienced with public transportation is (1) inconvenience - having to connect buses, trains, metro to go short distances and off-schedule or canceled times and (2) affordability and payment options - having to have exact cash for buses, Amtrack costs (it costs me $50 to go to UCLA and back). Public transportation needs major changes before we can change the cultural attitude that favors cars.
  <br><hr>

  I agree that this statistic was one of the most mind-boggling aspects of this entire video. We are raised to think that the best way to combat climate change is through these many technological solutions that involve fancy, expensive new technology. However, most of the time any effect that these goods have on the environment by saving energy or emitting the use of greenhouse gases is completely offset by how carbon-heavy the production of such technology is. I was also astonished to hear that by simply buying a car, you've already used up your "carbon budget" for the year. This is astonishing to me because many people think that buying a new electric car is something that can be a net positive for the planet when in reality, it's probably one of the worst things you can do. Buying new things, in general, is often bad for the environment, but it's especially real when it is something that takes such a laborious and resource-demanding process to create.
<br><br>
Another aspect of the electric car debate that I feel is important is the way that classism subtly affects many of the ways that we think about climate justice. Wen we associate electric cars with the battle against global climate change, we are really attributing the good work done across the globe by climate activists to a small group of mostly upper-middle-class suburban people who can afford to buy such an expensive vehicle. In reality, most of the people on the frontlines actually fighting the climate crisis are not in a position in which they can afford to buy an electric car or some new cool gadget that runs on solar power instead of batteries. These individual consumeristic choices are not the way to fight the climate crisis. If we want to move through this together, we will need to use our actions as individuals to organize a collective body that can demand change instead of simply begging for it.

I was every part of the people who believe technological innovations being the solution to the climate crisis before watching this lecture by Ken. Although I still believe this can be done in the future it was a very convincing lecture of why it should be time to give up on that and begin a cultural change. I do however believe that a cultural change is most important as we need as many people on board to fight the climate crisis and begin to make our planet better off. When Ken began to talk about the carbon footprints of cars I was really surprised of how much carbon emissions are released from not even driving the vehicle. Like many people I am sure, I also did not take into account the manufacturing aspect of the  automobile. I truly did not realize how much cars negatively affect the climate crisis and how it counts for nearly a quarter of people’s carbon footprint. The moment I heard that statistic I just thought about how many cars I see daily just biking from IV to campus. I just wonder why so many cars in such a small city when many people here are very passionate about cleaning the planet. That being said it is just hard for me to believe that a big enough cultural change will occur to get rid of cars. Cars are one of the biggest luxuries that the world has to offer for people and is something everyone at one point dreams of getting. As much as I want to help the planet I cannot just sit here and say that it is easy fix because in all honesty it is probably one of the hardest. I believe the best that can be done is limit the amount of cars people have because personally I know many families that own several cars just for different occasions like Ken mentioned. The challenging part for me is I would be unsure how to tell them how bad that is for the environment and to convince them to limit themselves. Some of Ken’s most convincing arguments for this topic was when he brought up the three substitutes for automobiles and how much more efficient they were then automobiles. Bus being fourteen times more, subways being twenty times more, and trains being thirty times more efficient. This was very shocking, but once I thought about it I was able to make more sense about it. Probably the most convincing out of all was the cost of sustaining an automobile on a yearly basis. Ken mentioned how it roughly costs nine thousand dollars a year to keep a car which is rather insane considering how much cars cost in general. The second point was that nearly one day of working goes directly towards keeping a car and that by just saving that nine thousand a year it can allow you to retire much younger than what the average age is. These were all convincing and efficient points Ken laid out for us, but despite all of those positive factors I simply cannot see a world without automobiles, or even less of them. It is too big of a luxury that people want and that is much more convenient than inconvenient. I feel that with technological innovations there could be a better way of making them and it will have zero carbon emissions, but until then I do not see a big enough cultural change happening. I may be wrong and honestly hope I am wrong about this, but I just cannot see a planet without cars.

<p>
I was shocked to hear that the production of an electric car releases 15-68% more CO2 than the manufacturing of a regular car. I always thought electric cars were the clear eco-friendly choice, but turns out it still releases large amounts of CO2. As Ken pointed out, electric cars are still better than regular cars if we think in terms of the life span of a car, however, electric cars do not solve the issue of cars. Being that cars are the biggest part of our carbon footprints, this is the main problem that we want to tackle. I do not think it is possible, however, to convince the public that cars are unnecessary. Sure, they are expensive and can seriously injure or kill drivers, but they give us one thing that mass transit and bicycles can't. They give us more time and convenience. I have learned about the struggles without a car for the past 2 years now. If I want to go to a yoga class I have to plan it out and leave almost an hour to 30 minutes before to get there at my desired time. Whereas, if I had a car, I could leave ten minutes before. The bus system is not large enough to be running buses every 5 minutes and because of this people do not like wasting time waiting for the bus to come and are forced to leave at earlier times than they would've liked. I find myself wishing that I had a car so that I would not have to lug my groceries on the bus and I would have more time to do other things. I do see the effects that cars have on our planet and I do not agree with cars in that. sense. If I were to get a car I would definitely get an electric car. Convincing everyone to stop buying cars seems unrealistic. Everyone is willing to pay the expensive cost and risk their lives for the freedom and convenience cars bring If there were a technology that reduced the carbon footprint of cars to zero, but still allowed humans to get where they want in a timely fashion then would the public be convinced. As of now, people do not want to take a five hour train ride when they could drive to their destination in half the time. We need to find a technological solution because I think changing car culture is going to be too difficult.

Could not have said it any better. The reason why most people prefer driving cars over taking public transportation is not because it is "cooler" but because people want and need to travel according to THEIR schedule, not the bus's or subway's schedule. While I am not disagreeing with the fact that manufacturing and using cars are leaving a massive carbon footprint and that curtailing these actions would be helpful, making subways and trains cooler and more appealing solely based on public perception is not going to be most effective means of combating this problem. A cultural change may change how much people love the convenience of owning and driving a car, but no amount of social persuasion can change the fact that driving usually saves time and does not require waiting, which plays a significant role in choosing one's mode of tranportation because no one likes to wait for something/someone, no matter how patient. I believe prioritizing the improvement of the overall efficiency of public transportation will sway more people from spending so much money on cars.

A big takeaway from this lecture was that removing cars from our life would not make it more difficult, but actually much more free and easier, while also saving the planet. I was also pretty taken aback by the fact that simply having one car sitting in your garage without use already used up the guideline of 2 tons of CO2 emissions for a single human. I was also disappointed by the fact that the amount of cars produced can wrap around the earth 31 times. There are way too many cars, man. They are literal death traps made cool by social hierarchy. This relates to Thoreau's argument that a more minimalistic life is a much freer and simpler way of life. Rather than creating more technology and hunks of metal to deal with the excess amount of cars, merely moving towards removing them from our lifestyles could benefit both humans and the planet.

I agree. Ken poses a question at the end of the video in which he asks whether or not we think that we have to change certain aspects about the way we live in terms of modern society and technological advances. The fact of the matter is, that if we want to live at all, then we MUST take an initiative towards living more sustainably. As these facts and stats presented in this lecture come to show, one of the most impactful changes we can make as individuals is limiting and reinventing our day to day car usage. There are practical ways to do so, and for a lot of us, public transportation is not only accesible but also more economically efficient. It just takes a conscious decision and action to start living more environmentally sustainable lifestyles.

Why the climate crisis is a cultural problem (and why electric cars are more trouble than good)
<br><br>
Climate crisis is a cultural problem because the whole society is driven by the cultural cohort of consumerism, by gaining more we could be better. Advertisements, magazines, lectures, movies and all other main information transmitting channels are promoting people to purchase to consume. Under such influence, consumerism is spreading all over the globe. 
<br><br>
About electric cars are more trouble than good because of the lifetime of its battery compares to gar that burns gasoline, I think consumers are once again stepping into the scene of acting eco-friendly but not realizing an electronic car with shorter lifetime might cause more waste to the whole society. Inefficiency is the problem for transportation.

Just as the video says, most people buy a car because they think it is cool. I think the most important part of letting people take public transportation is changing their thoughts about how cool is for driving a car. If people think taking the bus with friends is a cool thing, then I believe most people are willing to do so. Also, I think there should be some actions that can tell people about the negative impact of buying and driving a car. There should be more videos like this in order to tell people driving a car is not a cool thing for the environment, and it also has a negative effect on the freedom that they desire.

This video touches on what is, in my opinion, the most important part of this class- how can the climate crisis can be stopped through the use of social/humanities based intervention. This is something that is often overlooked when it comes to discussing how to save our planet. I had previously been a fan of electric cars, and they are obviously better than non-electric cars in terms of emissions, but I had never thought much about the cost of production. The statistic that simply just owning a car (not even driving it) will take up your recommended 2 metric tons of emissions per year is astonishing. Technology will continue to create more efficient cars I’m sure, but that will not stop the issue of production emissions. The cultural shift that needs to occur in order to make cars less appealing is part of a greater necessary shift towards the minimalist movement, which is championed by Thoreau. Most of the things that we own in a first world country have to be produced. Our clothes are made in factories, our food is heavily processed, and of course our cars and all other technologies are manufactured. Unless some miraculous discovery is made in the next decade that dramatically reduces or removes the emissions from large-scale production, we need to focus on a cultural shift, as Ken as stated. I think that this shift is starting to take hold, but in very small ways. For example, thrift shopping is now seen as cool and trendy. My mother refuses to buy second-hand clothing items because she thinks it is “unsanitary” (she’s a bit of a germaphobe but that’s beside the point), but many people in my generation accept it with open arms. Our generation is more likely to be open-minded to these lifestyle changes, as we have a lot to lose if we remain stagnant. Large cultural change seems to be our biggest hope, but it is also the most difficult to enact as it requires active effort from the entire population. We can’t just sit around and wait for new technology anymore. I think the best way to kickstart this change is through education. People will not be willing to make drastic lifestyle changes if they don’t understand why. And not everyone has to take a college class like this one to become educated. Even just having conversations with family members might inspire a greater awareness about our carbon footprint and what can be done to reduce it.

I appreciate your emphasis on how we can’t wait around for technology to catch up, and on the generational gap when it comes to secondhand items. When my grandpa got married and had a steady job for the first time, he never bought second hand clothes again and still refuses to. Growing up so poor that he had no choice, he sees it as proof that he was able to improve his life. We see cars as such cultural status symbols, as ken mentioned in class, and it’s so difficult to sever the connection in our minds between cars and class. Our fascination in cars and the freedom it represents is so deeply intrenched in the American psyche it might as well be the covered wagons promising wealth and new life. From the transcontinental railroad to our fascination with flying, and our highway system that boomed in the last century, America has such a fixation on transportation. Moving away from your past and toward your future. Well we can’t run anymore, the future is here and we kinda have to do something about it.

I think the reason that cars are seen as cool and buses are not can be traced back to the United States’ obsession with consumerism. As Ken stated in this lecture, there are so many downsides to owning a car: it eats away at income, it is very dangerous, and it increases carbon emissions. Why would someone choose to make such a big commitment to a car if it seems like more of a burden than a tool? It’s because we are too infatuated by the idea of flashing our wealth, which we can easily use cars to do. 
<br><br>
I am unsure if it will be possible to completely change the car obsessed culture we have in the United States. It seems like this would be possible in big cities like New York or San Francisco, which have transportation systems like buses and subways. However, in the suburbs (where about 175 million Americans live) and rural areas (where about 46 million Americans live) I think it will be difficult to shift this culture. Many of these places do not have efficient public transportation systems to get residents across town with ease. It would be irresponsible and altogether too easy to say people in rural and suburban America are too in love with their cars and that they are the problem, when in reality public transportation is too inefficient there to have any appeal. I have faith that big cities will make a huge shift, and hopefully the government will notice this change and decide to provide the budget to implement better public transportation.

I found this lecture video particularly interesting because I have wanted to learn more about the specific effects that cars have on our planet and whether or not electric cars were better for the environment. A typical car in the United States emits around 4.6 metric tons of CO2 per year which averages to account for ¼ of an individual's carbon footprint. This fact is crazy to think about because Ken mentioned in the video that if we wanted to limit global temperature rise to 1.5-2 degrees celsius, each person can’t emit more than 2 metric tons of gases. An average person is already emitting double this amount by owning a car. I knew that cars emitted a large amount of CO2 into the atmosphere, but I wasn’t aware that it was this large of an amount. One of the things I was most curious about was whether or not electric cars were better for the environment or not. In the long run, electric cars are better than normal cars that utilize gas, even though manufacturing an electric car emits more Co2 than a normal car. However, this still does not make electric cars “good” for the environment. One of the main things that shocked me was when Ken mentioned the fact about buying a car every 11 years. Even if you buy a car every 11 years, and don’t drive it AT ALL, you will still have exceeded your CO2 allotment (doesn’t include food, clothes, etc). Overall, cars are an environmental disaster! We need to start utilizing options such as buses, trains, subways, walking, biking to help save the future of our environment. It should not be that hard to switch to one of these many options, however people seem to be against it. People find driving a car way more appealing than driving a bus, taking a train, or even walking even though these options are 14-30 times more efficient. I also never realized the financial burden that cars cause on individuals. I thought it was interesting when Ken mentioned that one day of work per week is what it takes for us to afford a car. I never thought about this but it makes so much sense. If people were to get rid of cars, they could hypothetically have a three day weekend and even retire in their late 40’s. We would be benefiting immensely from getting rid of cars. We would be saving so much money and saving the environment at the same time. This seems like such an easy resolution, but it is one that will be hard to put into action. People are not going to be willing to just get rid of their cars and start taking the bus, subway, or train. It is a huge transition, so I believe we need to start with small steps. These small steps could include trying to take the bus to work at least 3 days a week instead of 5 days. Eventually we would be able to transition into bussing everyday and getting rid of cars for good.

I have also been curious about electric vs. conventional cars as my parents just went through the process of getting an electric car. I think that you put it well when you said that just because electric cars are “better” for the environment, it doesn’t make them “good” for the environment. Consumers need to start making decisions based not off of what is “better” for the environment (like driving an electric car), but off of what is “best” for the environment (not driving cars). However, I think that it will be a long time before this decision making is the norm. It will probably need to become “trendy” before people will start doing it, but once it does, I think that people will stick with it because of all the other benefits. I thought it was crazy when Ken mentioned that having a car is on average $9,000 a year. He went further to say that if you put the money that you annually spend on a car instead into your retirement starting in your early twenties, you could retire in your forties instead of sixties. I am twenty! Most people in this class are around twenty! Imagine if we all stopped using our cars this year. We would be able to retire roughly twenty years earlier AND reduce a quarter of our emissions. However, I agree with you that people, including me, will not be able to do this right away. I think that it will be a slow transition of people driving less and less until public transportation becomes trendy. I do think that this can happen though just as thrift shopping has become so trendy in recent years.

Hearing about all the damage that electric cars actually pose on our climate was truly shocking to me. Mainly because, I always thought my family was doing good by owning an electric car, but clearly, there is much more to the problem of climate change that I was not aware of. Another thing I didn’t realize is the fact that simply owning a car, even without every driving it, is damaging the earth immensely, more damage than the amount we should be making per year. This just adds to the multiple amount of reasons as to why people should use public transportation and bikes more often. The root of the problem with this, as I see it, is that cars have always been seen as a luxury. People make it a part of their life goals to own a specific type. That’s the society that we live in today, and it’s really difficult to convince people that they should forget about these goals they set out for themselves and begin taking buses. It comes down to the simple fact, as Ken states in this video, that these forms of transportation are just simply not as cool. What I never realized, is how this “cool” aspect of cars is really just a social construct people have become accustomed to believe with. For this reason, I think we will definitely have to change these types of standard living accustoms in response to the climate crisis.

I totally agree with you, just like Ken mentions in the lecture that in order to reduce the carbon footprints which are created by the crazy manufacturing and purchasing of cars, people must act on both the technical aspects and cultural practice.
<br><br>
In the past, many people bought electric vehicles for the sake of protecting the environment. These innovative vehicles seemingly produced 15-68 percent more of greenhouse gases than normal gasoline cars when they are manufactured, but they will only emit half of greenhouse gases than gasoline cars in their lifespans. However, it turns out that these people didn’t play the environmental-friendly roles. Even if they never drive their cars, the carbon dioxide emitted during the processes of manufacture them would be around 22 metric tons, which equals to 2 metric tons of emission every year. With today’s technology, it is impossible for people to create vehicles that are totally “zero carbon footprint.” Moreover, according to the research, the number of cars will reach about 2 billion in the next 15 to 20 years worldwide. 
<br><Br>
As a result, people should focus more on cultural practice, which includes the propaganda of “taking public transportations rather than private vehicles is cool.” For now, basically, every American who owns a car will work one day a week to afford his car. However, if they don’t spend the money on purchasing cars but store them in their retirement pays, they can retire at the age of around 40 rather than 65. Combine with the fact that buses are four times efficient than private cars, these public transportations should be strongly encouraged.
<br><br>
For the sake of protecting the planet and stopping the climate changes, people ought to purchase electric cars, or even not to purchase any cars but taking public transportations, and they must take action now before it is too late.

Hearing about how environmentally un-friendly electric cars really are is a little disheartening, especially since I would want to purchase an electric car as an adult. I live quite near New York City, where a majority of people walk and use the subway and very few people have their own cars. The subway system in NYC is ideal in my opinion, but how many large metropolitan cities are there that implement a subway system in this country? What about the rural areas of the world, where everything is spread out? How would those people begin to get around without cars? Putting a train or subway system is not realistic for every corner of this country, but if their use was implemented in all those areas where it is realistic, we could cut down our country's emissions by a decent amount. I don't think building some new "zero emissions" car is the answer, because such a project would likely require years worth of research, experimenting, building and testing that we simply cannot wait for. The affordability of such a car also comes into question; sure, we build a zero emissions car but how many people in the USA could afford such a thing? I don't really have a proposition for what to do. 3-day weekends and retiring early sound amazing, but I just find it hard to believe that the majority of Americans could do without a car.

Full disclosure, I'm attempting to write this response with a flu-ridden brain, so forgive me if the thoughts seem a bit jumbled. I also found this video to be a tad disheartening, and my emotions were all over the place throughout. There was disappointment when Ken pointed out that the total of 2 metric tons of CO2 we should produce individually per year would be entirely taken up by just the production of one electric car. There was doubtful consideration when he suggested that people should just not have cars. There is full blown disbelief that this will ever happen. Personally, I love driving, but I gave that up when I came to UCSB and could see permanently giving that up for this cause. Do I believe this of many other people though? No. I don't think you'll ever pry cars out of the hands of most Americans. I also agree with Ollie's concerns with public transportation in rural areas, where it's just not realistic to have buses and subways. I also have questions as to what would happen when you want to go somewhere that the general public doesn't typically. Say I wanted to go camping or to some random hiking trail- how would public transportation work in a situation like that?

I have always thought that whether technology and innovations are beneficial to society or bad, or at least do not help. Like for the climate crisis, electric cars will not solve the climate crisis, and they even emit as many gases as regular cars. Although they may produce fewer emissions while driving, there are 15 to 68 percent more greenhouse gases in the manufacture of electric cars than the production of regular cars. Moreover, these cars are more expensive, and people could not afford them. So, I should really ask a question: is technology a necessary thing? Or do we really need it? I believe that in this case respect to climate change, the answer is no. 
<br><br>
Ken also mentions that the climate crisis is a cultural problem. People who spend their money on some items, like cars and clothes, or buy something are affected by mass consumerism and consumer culture. They may purchase things that they think are cool, but this really harms the climate and may aggravate the climate crisis. To be honest, even for me, I hold these beliefs sometimes and I enjoy the pleasure of shopping. We should change and our beliefs should be changed. Consuming more unnecessary products or pursuing “cool” things are really bad to the climate and our Earth. This will produce even more greenhouse gases and waste more. This is not only a financial burden but also an environmental burden that people should really think about that.

I feel like that statistic about “a manufactured car is already equivalent to releasing two metric tons of CO2” was the most alarming and also made me question why our society acts as though they need all the latest and trending technologies i.e. cars. Although your argument/question is very controversial, I agree with you to some degree that we don't need all these technologies. However I do believe there are some that we do need, but like almost all things, nothing is good in excess. What I mean by this is that although some technologies and innovations are vital to our lives as humans (in my opinion) we have to drastically decrease our usage and waste of these innovations because they lead to long-term effects that are altering the state of this planet at an alarming rate. I have faith that with enough push we can change our consumerist culture and  shift to live more minimalistic, sustainable lives.

<br><hr>
In the lecture, Prof. Hiltner highlighted the connection between minimalism and the climate disaster we are going to have- the cultural practice of reducing climate change. He pointed out that instead of focusing on changing the technology we have in the current age, changing people’s behavior and consumption choice might be the wiser choice. 
<br><br>
From my point of view, this is really a new perspective to look at climate change. Conventionally, we prefer to use technology to address climate change. However, after these lectures and films, I prefer to say that the best way is through the combination of changing people’s economic behavior and improving technology development. As the later in consumption behavior takes longer time, the positive impact of technology development on climate change, though subtle, is quick.
   <br><Hr>
   After watching this lecture, I can't help but feel guilty for the amount of carbon footprint I've left by simply sitting in a car. The statistics on the subject of manufactured cars are certainly astonishing to hear. We certainly shouldn't pat ourselves on the back for being "saviors of the Earth", just because we've bought an electric car instead of one that traditionally runs on gasoline. 
<br><br>
How do we solve this problem, though? At least in the United States, driving a private automobile is still the primary way to commute; having lived in Europe for a year, I was perfectly happy with just taking public transportation; in this country though, it is fairly difficult to get anywhere if one doesn't have a car. So I'm going to play the devil's advocate here and suggest that people might not agree with the central idea of the lecture, unless a much more appealing way is presented (such as high-speed rail, which California definitely needs!_

After watching this video, I too agree with Ken that is more important to reduce our use of cars instead of switching to “zero emissions” vehicles. I found it interesting that the production and manufacturing of these cars that are advertised as better for the planet actually emit around 15 to 68 percent more greenhouse gases than similar gasoline cars. This shocked me because I have always thought that electric cars such as Teslas and priuses were the future and would help reduce our CO2 emissions. I think that mass transport is an excellent way to reduce our usage of cars and emissions. In countries such as Japan, every one of two company workers commutes by train which greatly contrasts the 85% of Americans who drive to work everyday. Although many people may think of cars as a more efficient mode of transportation, bullet trains, such as the shinkansen in Japan move faster than cars. Although it is not used for everyday transportation from home to work, the shinkansen is an easy, comfortable, and quick way to get from one prefecture to the next. For example, if you used a shinkansen to get from Tokyo to Osaka, it would take at most three hours to travel around 250 miles. In contrast, if you were to drive that distance, it would take you around six hours. This is just one example of how mass transport can be more efficient than cars.
<br><br>
One thing that I disagree with Ken about is that we will be able to eventually make “busses cool and cars less so.” Cars are such a large part of our culture, so to eventually switch people’s opinions to believe that cars are “uncool” is not realistic to me. I believe that car culture is too far ingrained into the customs and traditions of families across the world to diminish and give way to mass transport. I remember waiting anxiously to be able to drive myself wherever I wanted to go, whenever I wanted and embracing the feeling of freedom that came with driving. If you asked people to give up their cars and to adopt a lifestyle with mass transport, most people would probably say no. Although it may seem selfish, most people are not willing to give up the convenience of cars to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions.

</p><hr>

<p>
Ken’s lecture was very informative and made me realize limits to technological advancements. While the electric car emits less CO2 into the atmosphere, the amount is minuscule compared to the amount of CO2 is emitted when a car is produced. If real change is going to be made on the climate crisis, we need to start making cultural changes. 
<br><br>
I thought Ken’s points about the freedom of having a car was very intriguing. I have always viewed cars as a part of the American Dream. Cars allow Americans to drive where they want and when they want. For the majority of my life until now, I have never rethought the benefits of cars. Yes, I think cars are efficient. They are especially efficient in my suburban town. However, I think that Americans overhype cars. Cars have become trophy items and symbols of success. If you have a nice car, people think you are rich. People with the most money are the ones that have used the most greenhouse gas. What people do not know is that cars make up a quarter of a person’s carbon footprint in their lifetime and produce two metric tons of emissions. I was shocked to find out that the production of one car is equivalent to a year’s worth of human’s CO2 emissions. After finding this out, I thought about the celebrities that have dozens of cars lined up for display. It is simply outrageous and makes no sense environmentally. Americans willingly spend thousands a year on the maintenance of cars from insurance, repairs, and gas. I had no idea that someone could retire in their late 40’s instead of 65 if they did not own a car. I agree with Ken, that is real freedom.
<br><br>
We need to change the way Americans think about cars. When the car was first invented, people were not completely convinced that every family needed one. Now in 2020, we need to convince people that cars are not a necessity. In order to do so, more cities across the nation need to model New York’s effective public transit system. As public transportation becomes more accessible, I believe Americans will start to shift their point of view.

As Ken stated in the video, I find the fact that production of electric cars releases a massive amount of CO2 into the atmosphere to be very terrifying. Up until this point, I thought electric cars were helping to save the environment from these massive emissions. I feel like that’s a common belief. Compared to automobiles that run on gas, I do think electric cars are a step in the right direction. However, the effects are negligible that we’re still indirectly contributing to the climate crisis. The climate crisis is most definitely a cultural problem. American society has become so accustomed to purchasing nice homes, cars, clothing, jewelry, etc that we don’t realize how detrimental it is to our planet. However, the car industry specifically has become one of the largest in consumer market. Not only because they provide speed and efficiency in life, but because they also represent wealth and class. Because I’ve grown up in such a suburban area where cars are basically the only mode of transportation, it’s really difficult to think about life without one. Can we change this cultural issue? It’s possible, but it may be unlikely.
<br><Hr>
I’m optimistic that we can change our culture and the way we view cars. I believe that we can make a difference if we provide other efficient modes of transportation and educate the public. I live in a suburban city, but I am confident that if there was a well-organized public transportation system, people would use it. Yes, in America, cars are glorified and seen as a symbol of success. However, I think that the average person cares more about practicality than luxury.
<br><br>
This lecture has definitely made me rethink my decisions. I am living off campus next year and thought about buying a car to make running errands easier. After learning about how detrimental cars are for our planet, I have decided not to purchase one. Biking and taking the bus will work just fine and I will not have to worry about parking.

I love how Ken describes the need to look at the climate crisis from a social science and environmental humanities perspective. As a social science major myself, this gives me a sense of purpose and made me realize how I can contribute my specialization to mitigating the climate crisis. The simple statement of looking at the automobile industry as a cultural problem is fascinating. The first thing that it clears up is how we should be asking whether cars are even necessary, before jumping to conclusions of technological advances in more environmentally friendly cars. I never even thought to question why cars are so prized and wanted in America.
<br><br>
I agree that there needs to be a reengineering in the cultural practice of car use in America. I lived 4.5 months in Europe without owning a car, and traveled more of the continent of Europe than I have traveled the United States while owning a car. The issue is that public transportation by use of buses, subways, and trains is non-existent in America. The thought of implementing a public transportation system across the nation is an unbelievably complex task. Not impossible, but there would need to be new laws, restructuring of physical structures and urban planning, and so much discussion within town, city, and state governments. I love to travel, and I wish one day, people would be able to travel to different states in the U.S. by use of public transport, but there is bound to be pushbacks from people who do not want to change the status-quo when trying to implement new public transportation options as the norm.

Great points! I completely agree and  also feel that we should acknowledge that calling for more public transportation isn't as simple as wanting to ride public transportation more. 
<br><br>
I've actually never thought of what perspective I look at the climate crisis with: I just know that it's happening. I feel that most crises stem from human nature. If humans had no desires and emotions, solving the climate crisis would be easy. Solving the crisis isn't hard, but human emotions and desires make everything more complicated and troublesome. It's ironic that in wanting a better life for ourselves now, we make everything worse later. It's the same as procrastinating studying for midterms, but the consequences don't merely affect yourself, but instead everyone, even the people you don't know. 
<br><br>

I'm a Communication major, so I'm looking forward to the week on communicating the climate crisis. Yet, I know that majors don't really matter in the big picture, since only communicating the crisis is probably as effective as scientists providing the research with no one listening. 
<br><br>

Before I went out of the U.S. for a vacation, I had never ridden on a train before, unless you count Disneyland. I had only ridden on buses for school events. Most of my life was spent in a car because it was unreasonable to bike to anywhere I wanted to go because of sprawl. I grew up listening to how dangerous buses were, and trains were nonexistent as far as I knew. 
<br><br>

Yet, when I read books about other places, such as New York, Japan, and etc., the subway or train station is common. It amazes me that trains, which were once so important to the U.S., have become almost fictional in some places in California.
<br><br>

Just imagining how difficult it would be to make public transportation popular makes me feel a bit upset. For example, if people have cars already, why would they bother using public transportation frequently? Americans are used to privacy and expect it as much as possible. If I didn't consider the environmental consequences, I would probably never choose to ride a bus or a train if it seemed more convenient to ride a car. In a car, there's no one to cough or sneeze on you, while public transportation has higher chances.

In the video “Why the climate crisis is a cultural problem (and why electric cars are more trouble than good) by Ken, he analyses the roll of the automobile industry in our daily lives. He argues that cars are the leading causes of our main production of carbon dioxide. Out of the 20 metric tons of carbon dioxide that the average American produces a year, ¼ comes from the use of our car. What is more surprising however, is that even the acquisition of a car also contaminates the world (no usage at all). Moreover, the usage of cars can dramatically decrease the lifetime of a person and produce different levels of economic stress, yet we regard cars as one of the most important things that need to be included at some point in our lives. Now that I think about it, this is ridiculous. This means that the average American works arduously to afford their dream car, only to enter a lottery of live or death. The moment we drive a car our life is threatened by external forces that cannot be controlled. As Ken mentions, we consider cars to be “cool” and I thought that I knew the answer to that. My reasoning was simply because it provides privacy, liberty and freedom that is not given by mass transportation systems, but it never occurred to me that it could be more than that. After the addition of the U.S to WWII, America’s economic wealth significantly increased by the manufacture of ships, planes and automobiles. Seeing that the manufacture of automobiles was a viable and very successful business, the industry did everything in their power to hypnotize the American public into buying more cars. They bought senators to promote their usage and advertised the marvelous things this new technology could do. Ever since, automobiles have become “essential” to our lives. Personally, I don’t have a car, and you are probably thinking because I can’t afford it. Well, the reasons why I don’t own a car are because, 1) I don’t have a driver’s license, 2) I don’t know how to drive, and 3) I don’t need it. I find mass transportation to be more accessible and comfortable. I don’t have to worry about large payments, or causing an accident every 2 minutes. As Ken described, we need to attack this issue from a humanities point of view rather than a STEM point of view. As a STEM major, you can improve the technology by finding ways to reduce emissions of CO2. However, as a humanities major, you can understand the underlying issues of our addiction to cars, and end such addiction by shifting from the use of cars to the use of mass transportation. I believe this is one and will be one of the hardest issues to ever be solved. People love cars and I do not think for any second that they will give up such “luxury.” If we succeed to make mass transportation cooler than private-owned automobiles, then I believe we can do almost anything! This would definitely be big step to a cleaner and better world.

This lecture was a real eye-opener for me. I had no idea that manufacturing a car released so much COs. I was one of the many people who believed that electric cars would help save the planet. I guess I was very wrong. 
<br><br>
I was very surprised to learn about all the benefits of public transportation. I knew that it was better for the environment but I didn't know just how much it would reduce our CO2 footprint. If we really want to save the planet, we will have to start taking the bus, train, and subways. People also need to be informed of all the benefits of not owning a car. I know no idea that cars were so expensive. Every week you work, one day goes towards paying for your car. That's a lot of work just to maintain a car. I think that if more people knew this that they would be more inclined to take the bus. 
<br><Br>
I also agree with Ken that we need to find a way to make public transport cooler than owning a car. Maybe if we got famous and influential people to take the bus or subway. That would be very hard considering that most famous people own several very expensive cars. We especially need to convince Americans that public transport is the way to go. With America taking the bus the rest of the world is bound to follow.

If you find Hiltner's comment on a cheaper way of living, it is very captivating, especially with the foresight of early retirement and happy life. Not to mention the environmental effects of not owning this climate crisis is producing cost. Its amazing to me that on average, a car costs 9,000 a year and but I can believe that there are more cars than licensed people. This is how it is in America. I hope the ways of portland and communities like ours will become cool and take over the ways of lives of people. A lot like the monkey analogy Hiltner made about fashion, but now it is better for the climate crisis.

I too was shocked at the amount of CO2 emission that is produced from solely manufacturing cars. Since I can remember, there has always been an advocacy for electric cars and how they were generally more "environmentally friendly". This belief however, as we now know, is not only untruthful but also the complete opposite. I feel that the best way to spark the interest of public transportation over car use is to make others aware of this truth. I don't feel that urging famous and influential people to take public modes of transportation would necessarily be beneficial nor safe, however. Instead I feel that we must fix our transportation systems to be a lot more convenient for riders. One of the main reasons, I believe, that Americans would rather use cars is largely based on convenience. Often times, there aren't nearby stops (especially for trains and subways) that make it more accessible for people to ride, specifically in cities and towns that are more rural or suburban. I would also like to note that as years pass, there has been a nearly 10 percent increase in fare prices in only a decade. While long term the prices may save hundreds in transportation,  prices can be day to day hardships for people. Because you don't need to pay to drive your car everyday it can feel more convenient to use. If we were able to invest more to fix our public transportation systems, I feel that Americans would be more inclined to depend on public transportation. Though I don't completely know how we can entirely fix the system, I feel that making fares less expensive and adding more frequent stops and additional routes, would increase the likelihood for people to use various modes of public transportation.

I learned a lot from this lecture. Before watching it I hadn’t thought at all about the actual production of the electric car. I just always thought that owning an electric car was really good for the environment and reduced your carbon footprint by a lot. However, learning that the actual production of an electric car produces 15-68% more CO2 than the production of a regular gas car really surprised me. The issue isn’t the type of car, it is just the fact that there are so many. It is crazy that the average car in the US emits about 4.6 metric tons of CO2 per year, which is over double the amount each person is alloted in order to keep warming under the goal of 2 degrees celsius. And that is only from our cars. We emit so much more CO2 every year, including from our diets, our obsession with stuff, our air travel, and much more. 
 <br><br>
 The hard part is going to be convincing the population to change their lifestyle. However, if you think about it, it really shouldn’t be that hard, considering there are a lot of other benefits, in addition to helping the environment, that can result from reducing or eliminating the use of cars. The fact that a car costs, on average, about $9,000 a year is crazy. Without a car, you could be saving money and helping the environment, a win-win situation. This should be enough of an incentive for everyone to want to get rid of their cars, but for some reason it isn’t. 
<br><br>
Coming to school here has been a big shift for me in becoming more aware and conscious of the climate crisis and the steps that must be taken individually and society-wide to reduce our impact and reach the goals of the Paris Accord. Not having my car here has made a huge difference in how I get around. I ride my bike and take the bus whenever I need to get somewhere a little further. It feels good to know that a bus is 14 times more efficient than a car and obviously a bike is very efficient. I have found public transportation, not only in Santa Barbara, but in any city I have been in, is very user friendly and efficient. No need to pay for parking, sit in hours of traffic, or risk getting in a deadly accident. It seems to me like giving up on our fascination with cars could bring a lot of benefit to everyone. We just need to get past our consumerist culture and start living in more sustainable and environmentally friendly ways. Like Ken says, technology itself won’t combat the climate crisis. We need to deal with this catastrophe by implementing change to human behavior and culture, which isn’t such a bad thing.

I, too, had no knowledge about the actual production costs and the significant amount of emissions produced by electric cars compared to regular cars. It makes me think of how bad informed I was. I thought that since it was an electric car and it runs from renewable energy, it would highly decrease our carbon footprint. And although in the long term it does decrease our footprint, I agree with you and Ken. It is not about what car produces the least, it is about how our society is shaped and the culture practices and values that we carry among us from generation to generation. We emit so much CO2, it almost seems impossible to me for us to keep warming under 2 degrees celsius. I know you mention that you would think that it would not be hard to convince people because the benefits outweigh the commodity; however, I do not think most people can do such a selfless act, we tend to want to see instant results and I doubt that people will give up their cars while others don't. Going back to last week's video, it stuck to me that knowledge can be power if one acts upon it. Now we know, so we must put all of this in practice and be aware of this information while making choices that as a whole affect the entire world. Similarly, we must educate others if we can, and continue to learn more about the ways we can change our lifestyle habits that could contribute to the wellbeing of our planet.

I first started thinking about this issue when I was in high school. We had a foreign exchange student from Italy who I become close friends with. One of the first questions he asked me was about the size of the roads. Why were they so big and wide? I wondered what he meant, to me we had normal sized roads. As I got to know him more I learned that his family of four owned one vehicle, a 4-dour Fiat, which was only occasionally used for long trips. His mother took the train to work, his father rode a bicycle to work, he skateboarded to school, and his sister walked. In contrast, my family of five had four cars, one for everyone except my brother, who would soon get one after passing a license exam. Unfortunately I think the cause of the problem is in fact what Ken alluded to in the video, that cars are deeply rooted in our social identity. When I was in high school the only thing I wanted was a car. Perhaps the first 2,000 or so dollars I ever earned went directly to my first car. On top of that, the city of San Jose where I am from is so divided by urban sprawl that I cannot really get anywhere without a car. Even the nearest light-rail station is quite a ways away.

<br><br>
As a recent purchaser of an electric vehicle I had thought about the lifecycle carbon cost of owning a vehicle. Unfortunately I could not get past the fact that large-scale investment in public transportation is several years down the line for my city. It would be quite difficult to use public transportation until lines extended deep enough into the south end of my suburbanized neighborhood. Fortunately I have access to solar+battery storage EV chargers at my place of work so that will have to do for now. Looking into the future, it is clear to me that my children will not be getting cars when they become old enough for a license as was the case for me. I also hope to extend the longevity of my own vehicle by using public transportation whereever possible. Perhaps most importantly, using Ken's math, having just one electric vehicle for a family of four, would greatly reduce the per capita carbon footprint for a vehicle by dividing the 22 metric tons from production into about half a metric ton per person/year using the standard 11 year vehicle lifetime.
<br><br>

Even this approach is sort of a best case if we continue our culture of "independent/free" mobility and the subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. I think the future of transportation lies in city planning. So many of our cities are just simply not designed for mass transit. It seems the best opportunity for incorporating public transit into our cities is to include it in the first place. Or if a city is already built, to stop expanding development outward and instead infill cities to make it easier to build public transit. As for the future of cars, if there is one, hopefully artificial intelligence will help us create more efficient transportation with carpooling and automated vehicles.

Reading the comment on the foreign exchange student was interesting to me. We are so used to the mass amount of cars that go in and out of the highways every day and don’t ever think of the negative effects this vehicle is producing. The amount of cars that we have in just one family is normal to us and for that to change we need to change what is normal.  What also resonated with me was your comment on how cars are an important part of our cultural and social identity. At the age of 14, my parents told me if I wanted a car once I turned 16 and got a license that I would be the one paying for it. So we all could imagine I started from that day forward saving for my own car. I was a part of the younger people in my class, so by the time I was fifteen and a half it seemed like everyone had a car and it was so cool. Even in the year book you take pictures next to your car to be published on one of the pages. So when I finally turned 16 and got a license, I dropped all $7,050 I had been religiously saving for in the past 2 years. Once I got the used car, I realized that it needs insurance, maintenance, oil changes every month, and of course gas. Throughout my years in high school my hard work was wasted on this one vehicle. Now that Im a part of this class I know not only that that that was a waste of money but also that I took part in the 20 metric tons of CO2 released. 
<br><Br>
Now having the knowledge of these vehicles and that they are deadly, costly, and produce that amount of CO2 I am wanting to change my mode of transportation in a way that could benefit myself and the world around me. I agree with your comment that the “future of transportation lies in city planning.” I live in an area where it takes about 30 minutes to get to school by car so sometimes cars are needed in this sense. I hope that there will be a major change in the way transportation is made and used.

   As an international student, I cannot agree more with your friends' first impression on the United States. I have traveled to numerous countries. I have to say that in comparison to the other countries, America has the widest road for cars. In other countries, they focus more on public transportation. Buses, subway, and high-speed rail are common and convenient. Take Hong Kong as an example, in a city that is about 8,875 times smaller than the United States, they have multiple kinds of public transportation namely the Mass Transit Railway, taxis, buses, minibusses and tramways. This transportation network can take you anywhere in Hong Kong. In fact, most citizens do not own a car; all they need is an “Octopus Card” which brings them to work, school or home. As most international students are used to this lifestyle, it is hard to adapt to living in the United States where stores are far away from each other. Fortunately, UCSB has a relatively convenient transportation system. All students can easily go to school by bus or bikes. I sincerely hope that the American government can pay more attention to the problematic transportation system in most cities. This will not only help to assuage the traffic pressure, but also the climate crisis.

I really appreciate this comment! After this lecture video I was a bit upset. I had never really considered the environmental costs of producing electric vehicles, which I suppose is naive. I usually am good about refraining from buying into the idea of the technological silver bullet that will save us from the climate crisis, but this I suppose is one that I bought into. 
<br><br>
However, I really like this plan of yours, I think that trying to keep your ev for as long as possible, while utilizing public transportation and other forms of no-emissions transportation, and teaching your future family that having a personal car is irresponsible, is cool. It is obvious that we do not have the infrastructure for mass public transportation, and that getting it will take time, so I believe that we should all adopt similar strategies. 
<br><br>
I totally agree that city planning is the most important factor in solving the issue that cars pose, and I wonder how we could influence city planners to make public transportation a main focus. Any thoughts, Ken? 
<br><br>
I don't own a car yet, and my parents keep bothering me to get one– I don't want one, for all of the reasons that Ken stated; the costs, the maintenance, the danger, the carbon emissions. I think that I will try to go as long as I can without purchasing a car. I plan on trying to convince other people that public transportation is the future.
<br><hr>

I find your comment about your close friend from Italy intriguing. I experienced the same conversation with a close friend from Spain on the reputation and practices of the US. Specifically the idea of 'the bigger the better' and the impact this has had on an international stage. In regards to roads, consumption and transportation, it's hard to overlook. The enormous impact that business and energy interests have held on policy in regard to oil protection and subsidies in car manufacturing have only allowed these ideas to flourish. Also reiterating the fact that cities are so much in terms of pollution reduction in regard to public transportation. I think that this is an interesting point as suburban neighbors are often viewed in a positive light due to violence reduction and quieter environments, but what is often overlooked in the substantial environmental impact it contributes. Living in the Coachella valley, the makeup of many of our cities are prominent large homes and dependency on motorized vehicles. The lack of public infrastructure is a pressing matter, which is largely overlooked. In regard to school transportation alone, my school only had one bus line in and out of the school, which was the standard 'sun line' busses transporting all over the valley. In order to make it to school on time, students would have to board the busses by about 6:15/30 in the morning, to make it to school by about 7:35. Mind you, school began at 7:40. This bus-line was a necessity for many at our school, due to the location of our campus and the financial burden owning a car places on a family. Our school cited among our highest reason for chronic tardiness and absenteeism, the inability to get to school was among the top. Our district cut back the bus-line as a result of little return made, other than for field trips. This has also led to a reduction in after school programs such as tutoring or other extracurricular's for students who rely on the bus line after school to return home. Our environment heavily emphasizes the need for private transportation vehicles in regard to safety. As temperatures regularly soar over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, biking or walking, is not truly a practical option with long distances. They are also regularly late, and are commonly complained about in getting to a destination, by the estimated arrival time.Talking to students at UCSB, specifically from the Bay area, this is not really a problem they face. I strongly agree with Ken in that our cities and other communities desperately need to expand public transportation infrastructure, not only to help reduce our carbon footprint, bus also safety as well.
<br><hr>
I enjoyed reading your comment as it was in part a revelation and in part not surprising. In America, the automobile is part of one's identity. Their worth as a person is partly tied to the car that they own. It is seen constantly in media and everyday life. Many see a successful life as living in a large household, in the big city, with a high end vehicle. In that vein, I agree that in order to sever from this conformity, transportation must be addressed governmentally. Nowadays, public transportation is often looked down upon or substituted for more "convenient" or "independent" options. Why wait ten or fifteen minutes for the bus when I can just hop in my own car and drive myself that certain distance or order a rideshare vehicle. Unfortunately, with the normalization of rideshare options, public transportation is left wayside as a last resort or cheap option for poor people. It also harbors, for many people, fear because danger is seen as being tied with mass transit. Therefore, while city planning is a very important aspect, I believe that the most important aspect is normalizing public transport in all cities, not just New York or those cities that already commonly use public transportation way more than here in Santa Barbara. That normalization will need to come from people choosing to use mass transit rather than independently driving and teaching our and later generations that public transportation is the better, smarter, and more environmentally friendly option.

When I first came to the U.S., I was jealous of the wide and big road. And I always talked with my family that the U.S. has a really big road, and they never have traffic. But now I realize the big and wide road doesn’t mean it is good. I believe the reason why American people are fascinated with cars is that public transportation is not fully developed yet. No one wants to wait for 40 mins to take the bus, no one wants to rent the public bicycle if they are nowhere to find, and no one wants to use skateboard for a 30 mins ride while car only takes 5. Geographically, American has larger land and fewer people than China, so place to place is far. And riding Bicycle and walking seems impossible in the U.S.. And I remember a sentence my friend told me that “if you don’t have a car, you can’t go out in the U.S.” But still, the bus, train, and subway system should develop. At least, it should reach the goal that it can take me to anywhere I want in the state, and I could take it at any place I stand. I’ve lived in both LA and Cleveland for two years, and during those four years in the U.S., I haven’t taken any public transportation yet. Or I can say I can’t even find them in the city.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment, especially the part about the student from Italy. My family is Canadian and whenever they visit they always comment on how our roads and highways are so wide. They even describe our highways as so "scary" and complex and confusing and large. I live in the Bay Area, where the best way to get around is by car. My high school didn't even have a bus system, so the only way to get there was driving. Everyone had to drive everywhere. I completely agree that in order for people to stop using cars as much, we must change the infrastructure of many major cities. In cities such as Tokyo, it is possible to get anywhere with public transportation but in places such as the Bay Area, cars are essential. Public transport would not only benefit the environment, but it would help those who cannot afford to buy a car at all. The economic benefits of good public transportation would make a big difference for many American families. In general, the benefits are worth it. 
<br><br>
For now, however, those of us who rely on our cars need to use them responsibly. Carpooling or ride sharing does make a difference and should be regarded as something worth practicing regularly. Cars should be used for their entire lifespan instead of buying a new one simply because it is new. In addition, as you stated, families should try their best to limit the amount of cars they own.
<br><hr>
It is quite astonishing how Europe and the US have such a large discrepancy in our methods for transportation. I am also from the Bay Area, Napa to be specific, and while it is a smaller city, you rarely see people biking to get to work or just get around; most people just do it for exercise and to enjoy the outdoors. The bus system just doesn’t seem great either, and the Wine Train is no way to actually commute anywhere, it’s a leisurely ride up valley for people who want a different way to experience Napa and its surrounding cities and vineyards. Getting to any other major cities like Sacramento or San Francisco at least from Napa pretty much requires going by car, at least most of the distance until you get to a BART station, assuming it’s even worth using. My family has always had 3 or 4 cars too, and to make it worse, they either wanted gas guzzling SUV’s or sports cars, which unfortunately influenced my decision to make my first car a Camaro. In hindsight, it wasn’t a great purchase, and I now realize that my decision to buy the car was heavily influenced by our culture and our desire to have “nice” things regardless of how they affect the environment or those around us.
<br><br>
I do hope to purchase an electric car in the future and keep it for a while, but I also really hope that public transportation becomes more easily accessible, efficient, and clean. I totally agree that our cities are currently not suited to maximize the use of public transportation, and it would require a massive infrastructure overhaul to accomplish it, but it does need to be done. We also need to shift our mindset as Ken noted and really make using public transportation the norm for everyone.
<br><br>
 If we could do that, then putting money into better transportation could happen quickly if the demand for it is great enough.
<br><hr>

I agree with all of what you have said. In the state that the U.S. is currently, sometimes cars are the only convenient mode of transportation. Our infrastructure is made for cars. Ideally I would also love for public transit to be the norm, but to do that our current infrastructure must change, but by the time that happens I worry that it might be too little too late. Essentially, I see us at an impasse. We need immediate change to negate the changes happening to our climate. Yet I do not foresee America to change its car dependent culture so quick. And even if everyone came to the consensus that cars must be cut out from our lives, which is a greatly improbable if by itself, could we set up the infrastructure in time?
<br><br>
Of course, any positive change is better than no change at all, so I like your thoughts of minimizing your carbon footprint of your future family by buying less cars and using public transportation more often. I wish to adopt similar changes in my life as well. Nonetheless, transportation alone will not be the only change needed to get us where we need to be, especially if simply owning a car will be enough to meet our carbon emission limit. We shouldn't simply look at each other in guilt for owning vehicles for their emissions during manufacturing, but instead hold these manufacturers accountable for their emissions to push them into refining their process in order to limit the own emissions. We will go much farther in reaching our goal if we cut emissions all the way from the top.
<br><hr>

I really relate to this comment. Cars are basically seen as integral to many people's way of life in America, especially in areas where public transport is not reliable, basically non-existent, or if it makes you feel unsafe or uncomfortable. Almost everyone I knew in high school were over-eager at the prospect of getting their license and a car. People work their butts off just to be able to buy a car because owning a car seems symbolic of freedom, independence, and becoming more mature and responsible in life. Personally, in my hometown, I basically had to rely on people driving cars because public transport isn't practical in the slightest. I am always aware of how detrimental driving cars is, especially given how terrible our air quality is to begin with, but there aren't really any other practical options for us. 
<br><br>
Also, quite frankly, I was too very naive to the idea that electric cars really don't have beneficial impacts to the earth in the way most people think. Like a few others have mentioned, I knew technological advances can really only do so much to actually benefit the environment, and realistically, any benefits that would come from these advancements would take awhile to fully show results. Yet, it had never struck me just how damaging the production of electric cars still was to the environment. It's fascinating, but also disturbing, that the farther along we get into this class, the more I realize how little I truly knew about the climate crisis and how much humans affect it.
<br><hr>
In high school, all the rage was getting a car. Except I was in no rush about getting a car (or even a license). The culture was that it was a cool, never-ending fad and a symbol of independence. While everyone did that, I got rides from people and took the bus. And I got teased for it a bit. Now that I come to think of it, this small town literally had car dealerships EVERYWHERE. So there was a big culture for cars in this town...but everything was walking distance. In addition to that, there was also a huge refinery in the city and it was expanding by this company named Tesoro. And what's even more ridiculous, Tesoro also gave my high school's science program lots of money. So, I guess you could say it was very toxic (pun intended) and everyone had asthma. But it feels like a set up, which it is. Low income town, minority-filled, and not much education going on? It is perfect for companies to take advantage of these people. It is sad and unjust in every way possible.

I had never previously took into account the size of our roads here in the U.S. The insight that you brought up in the first part of your comment in which you compared your lifestyle differences with that of your Italian friend were very telling of how we as Americans have created and normalized oversizing of so many things in our modern life. I had never thought much about all of the oversizing that takes place in the U.S. until recently, and know with what I have learned so far in the climate crisis course, it troubles me very deeply. I believe that this is the largest problem America currently faces in changing the current state of our climate. In the case of cars and electric cars uprising is still evident. I find it comical that if electric cars were actually being made to reduce climate effects and create positive change in the world they would not be so large and they would not require such a ridiculous carbon foot print to create. The carbon foot print that is required to just create an electric car is absurd and I believe that personal cars will soon be obsolete and if they do not then our society needs to be deeply committed to doing so. Public transportation will ideally be taken more seriously and hopefully utilized by many more people in the future. I believe that once the entire world starts to really take the climate crisis seriously then issues like transportation will have to actually be looked at and revised.


<br><hr>
I never thought about it from this perspective, but this is entirely true. I remember in high school getting a car was one of the things I was looking forward to the most. It was not even because I had a love for cars, but simply so that I could go where I want to on my own time. This was a desire stemming from the way our society functions, even down the physical infrastructure of hometown (Los Angeles) which promotes having a car. Living in LA, I have first-hand experience of the negative effects of over-usage of automobiles as it can take an hour plus to travel ten miles due to the excess cars on the roads. Not only does this have terrible implications on the environment from an emissions standpoint, it is also scary to think that these numbers will only increase as the populations continually rise unless something is done to mitigate these effects. Furthermore, there is also a societal stigma when it comes to public transportation. I have witnessed people judge and call others poor for taking the bus, where in reality they are doing a service to the planet by using these means of transportation. We live in an individualist culture that propagates individual achievement such as owning multiple cars or having 5 cars per household. It is time that a new wave of transportation, or thought in general, be developed or else we will never cease to degrade our earth.

This comment was extremely interesting for me because it is absolutely true. In the United States, we are more focused on having cars to get to places. It is simply a longstanding tradition that for your 16th birthday, some fortunate kids are to be gifted with a car. In addition, it is true that the average family has multiple cars- especially if the parents need one each to get to work and their kids to school, respectively. However, it is different like this in other continents such as Asia. I remember when I visited Korea that the main form of transportation was the subway. All you had to do was purchase a metro card that you loaded with money and that would be able to take you essentially anywhere in Korea as long as you took the correct route. It is very interesting to me to see the difference in forms of transportation in different countries across the world. I do believe that us Americans need to invest more in mass transit so that we are able to save more and expend less gas emissions into the atmosphere. Los Angeles is known as the city with such severe traffic because it is a main bustling point. It is important to note that this future of transportation really needs to be changed and it can be done so through the cities and their planning. By planning for the future, we will be able to create a more efficient form of transportation that will lower the cost of emissions into the atmosphere.

I was thrilled by the statistics that Ken gave, especially for the idea of two metric tons of CO2 emission per person and year. I find this extremely interesting and meaningful. Instead of talking about keeping global temperature increase in 2 degrees Celcius, Ken gives us another way that is easier, more straightforward and more tangible to look at keeping the temperature in a safe increase range. I now believe that under such a "scripted" cultural awareness, it is nearly impossible to keep the two metric tones of CO2 as the bottom line and one of the biggest problems here is our ingrained dreams about cars. There is no doubt that we should reconsider the possession of cars rather than considering the new technological hybrid and electric cars although they truly solve part of the problem in driving but continues the problem in production. What Ken asks us to do here is realistic as we should reconsider the option of buying a new car.
<br><BR>
On the other hand, I find it not appealing to me when Ken talks about saving the money from the costs of cars and for future uses. It sounds economically possible to me on the first hand but then I start to realize that the car industry is the backbone of most economies in the world. It is because the car industry not only propels the production of a country but also stimulates consumption and generates thousands of jobs. I am much aware that consumption under the consideration of our planet is a negative force. However, we can't deny the positive outcomes from the car industry like jobs and growth. I think that it is impossible to maintain current growth rates if we are going to change most of our styles and beliefs. So it is important to keep in mind as Ken says "we already have much stuff that generations before us don't have." It is a great point of view to teach our generation and future generations to give up something unnecessary and our privileges to take necessary actions in saving the planet.

I like how you address what you found interesting in Ken's snippet. Then, address the positive impact of car productions to the economy. 
<br><br>
And you made a good point that we should reconsider owning a car rather than debating to buy a regular or electric car. It's best to not own car in the first place and to use more sustainable mass transits. What I find interesting is that there are more cars than people who are licensed, this means car production is still going on and will only become bigger as our population grows. I think we need to take action in promoting the use of buses, increase bike friendly roads, make mass transit systems more convenient. Because personally I would own a car solely because of how convenient it is to get around, I really do want the transit systems to be MUCH more efficient, so more people use instead of buying cars.

I think its a little naive to think that our generation can change this part of consumer culture, especially living in a place like California. People cherish their cars. Then you have to think about the rest of the country. In Utah you can drive 6 hours straight and not leave the state, not to mention Texas. The USA is so big that to make a reliable transit system would take an enormous amount of movement. In NYC, more than half the city (approx 4.3 million people) ride the subway each day. I have personally never learned to drive. When I came to California, people were surprised. I expected that. What I wasn't expecting, or perhaps had just never thought about, was when I ran into another New Yorker from upstate, and she gave me the same look. It wasn’t a New York thing not to drive, it was a NYC thing. Driving is the way of commute that developed because of how people were spaced, it allows them to live farther from where they work, and connects them to opportunities they may have never had in the first place. I’m not saying it's a good habit, but it seems at the moment, an essential one. There are of course ways to limit driving, including adding a carbon tax and encouraging people not to drive. But without another solution of how to connect places EFFECTIVELY, it doesn't seem like it is a problem that will get addressed soon.

  I had the same thoughts regarding the feasibility of phasing out cars. I think this issue is really tightly coupled with reinventing the spaces that people live in. In another class we looked at how in order to encourage public transportation cities should be built in hubs where people live closer to the things they need and each hub is connected by trains/busses etc. Obviously this requires huge infrastructure and cultural change that will take many years. To me, the sad reality is that US's dependence on cars isn't going to change any time soon. This isn't to say that we should give up on improving the current public transportation infrastructure and make it "cool" - in my lifetime alone I have witnessed public transportation improve in my city. Along with this, however, we should be pressuring automakers to minimize production emissions and make cars last longer so that people are buying cars less often.

I found this lecture very eye opening.  There are so many things in the media that make us think we’re doing so much to help the planet when in reality when you look at the facts these things aren’t nearly as helpful as you’d think.  The electric car example is very relevant in this case in that it really makes no difference in the world in terms of the carbon footprint that is left.  Another thing that is mind boggling is that the car ownership in China has increased %10000.  It is sad how much we rely on our own personal cars rather than taking the train or bus as an option, or biking to places that are accessible.  It is clear that what is wrong with humans in the climate crisis is our laziness.

 I definitely agree that there is a huge misconception when it comes to the effectiveness of electric cars. I too, thought that companies like Tesla would be the way forwards in terms of renewable automobiles, but the fact that Ken argues for the abandonment of cars as a method of transportation seems pretty eye-opening, especially once he revealed the emissions that automobiles have on our environment. One car has the output of 2 metric tons of CO2 a year, which is equivalent to the output that one should have for an entire year itself. When considering who has cars and is able to use them, its likely that many of those people will also live more CO2 heavy lifestyles, since they are in the position to do so. Cars are definitely a huge source of emissions for us and that number will only grow when looking at the rate of countries like India and China. Additionally, there are only 1 billion cars on the planet while there are over 7 billion people on the planet, making cars a long way from being as accessible as they will be if we continue on this trend.
<br><br>
My main concern with the entire idea of getting rid of cars is the amount of time it would take to re-imagine entire countries' infrastructures. What will we do with all the roads? How can we make trains and subways and buses more accessible to do things like grocery shopping or going to the movies? Sure its not too bad in cities like New York, but in many other places it seems almost impossible unless some major actions are employed in the next few years.
  <br><hr>
I have to respectfully disagree with the fact that human laziness is the main reason behind why we do so much damage to the climate with our cars. As much as we like to say it’d be so easy to always use public transport, we can’t deny the convenience of having a car. I definitely agree that biking or walking when you can would be great for going to get lunch or meeting up with a friend not too far away. However, it’s not the most practical for commuting to work an hour away or similar situations. Additionally, as a girl, I constantly think about the fact that some of the more environmentally safe options are not necessarily safe for me. Getting on public transport or walking home alone at night are things I can’t even consider doing; not out of laziness, but out of fear for my well being. As much as I would like to reduce my carbon footprint, there are times where I have to think about my safety first. I would love to look into finding more reliable and safe options (specifically for women) to help us ladies get around in an environmentally conscious way.

 I agree completely with your statement that the media is highly responsible for our reluctance to combat the issues we are facing. In the era of social media, there is a lot of fake news and false information circling constantly. Therefore, it is difficult to know which information is true and which isn't. I agree that the electric car example is a great one because so many people think that just by switching to Hybrid, they are creating a solution. This is a common misconception since electric cars are still bad for the environment because many GHG's are created through the process in which they are manufactured. Hopefully the transition into more public transit incentives will increase their usage, however laziness does't alone seem to be what's wrong with humans in this climate crisis. What's wrong is the divide between us and real solutions. With real media coverage and accurate information, these solutions can hopefully be achievable.

 After taking Ken’s English 22 class, I learned the ugly truth behind the climate crisis and knew I could no longer ignore the glaring issue. I began trying to discuss the situation with my mom and friend. When they noticed me getting more despondent and hopeless about the topic, they told me that it wasn’t my issue and not to worry because technology would come out to mitigate the crisis. That’s when I realized the crux of our epidemic. The reason why we are in this situation in the first place is because nobody wants to take personal responsibility. Instead of trying to prevent the issue, people selfishly go about their daily lives, doing whatever they want regardless of the consequences. They justify this in their minds because some magical person with magical new technology will fix the issue and save us all. These people are living in a fantasy. There will be no magical technology that can make the problem disappear. 
<br><Br>
I entirely agree with Ken's claim that electric cars are more trouble than good. Things like electric cars are in a way, furthering our issue because it is focusing our attention on the wrong thing. It is giving us a false sense of relief, an out, that the climate crisis is not our problem, but rather a problem that will be resolved by technology produced by scientific geniuses. This mentality of “diffusion of responsibility” must be eradicated in order for our planet to progress in our quest to conquer the climate crisis.

I completely resonate with your feeling of hopelessness about this issue.  I feel like when I talk about the issues we discuss in class with my family, they brush it off without even thinking about what I'm saying.  It's almost like when a toddler is saying something and their parent responds with an absentminded "Uh huh, honey, that's nice."  I don't think people want to face the consequences of their actions and they certainly don't like being reminded of the harm they are causing.  
<br><br>
I also agree that electric cars can cause a lot of issues.  When I talk to my dad about cutting back on his meat consumption or other issues, he just responds with "Well, I have a Tesla so I'm not using gas!"  While it is great that he doesn't need to use gasoline, I don't think he realizes just how much waste went into creating the car itself (especially as Teslas are made-to-order).  He also doesn't realize the electricity that is used to power his low emissions car is likely provided by those same gas and coal companies.  I loved your statement that these cars provide us with a false sense of relief.  Like my dad, others think that because they've done one thing to help mitigate the issue, they have free rein to release those emissions in other parts of their lives.

 The most interesting statistic in this lecture was that a car post production has already released at minimum 2 metric tons per year of CO2, which is the yearly average people are supposed to maintain.  This is a mind boggling amount and highlights that cars are not the way of the future.  Cars will likely never be useless as some areas are far away from metropolitan areas.  But we need a concerted effort to place cheap and convenient public transportation (i.e. buses, trains, ferries, etc.) in as many places as possible.  

<br><br>
As I have mentioned in other posts, Europe already has a great system of public transportation.  In particular, the northern countries have a quick and efficient system that places some sort of transit stop within approximately a quarter of a mile from wherever you are.  Though America is much larger than these countries in terms of land, we are also much larger in terms of economy.  We could easily finance a national transit system and implement it within the next few decades, as long as the public got on board with the idea.  
<br><br>

The problem with gaining the public opinion is that car culture has become one of the defining characteristics of America.  When I was talking with some Swedish high schoolers, one of them asked me if I had a car and used it to drive along the coast.  Though this sounds a little funny, it shows how pervasive this cultural perception is at the world stage.  Even if we manage to change our car culture (which seems unlikely), it will be quite a chore to convince the rest of the world that this is no longer the way.

I agree with you that public transportation is probably our best hope to fight climate change and fix our "car culture". While having your own stylish, affordable car has been a part of the american dream for decades, we need to change if it means saving the planet. While it may seem hard to completely shift to a public transportation system, many countries and cities have already done it. Not only does Europe have a great transportation system, but I know from experience that many Asian countries such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and many cites in China do as well. Not only are they affordable and convenient, but they are clean and safe. New York's subway system is well-designed and a potential model as an American city, but it fails to keep up in the safety and hygienic department. However, if the rest of the United States can shift to public transportation, maybe its possible to not only drastically lower our carbon emissions, but to prove to the parts of the world that look up to America that public transportation, rather than individual cars, is the way to a better, cleaner future.

<br><hr>
I agree that the car culture has been deeply rooted in Americans, ranging from middle-aged people to teenagers even. To change a culture is much more difficult than to change the energy source used by an automobile. Some of my sophomore and senior friends spend a lot of time talking about and selecting the cars they want to buy. And although the descriptions like “death traps” and “fake freedom” sound a bit exaggerated and frightening, I know they are actually telling the truth.
<br><br>
After watching the video "Why the climate crisis is a cultural problem (and why electric cars are more trouble than good)”, I was especially surprising to hear the simple calculation that the carbon footprint made by simply manufacturing an automobile is already exceeding the 2 metric tons of carbon of standard signed in the Paris Accord. One thing in the case of electric cars I think that connects the cultural aspect and the technological aspect is that all the efforts and time spent on innovating the electric cars actually results in excess advertisement and promotion of this product. People are actually more likely to consume cars because of the marketing of this new feature of automobiles. With this being said, while the gasoline vehicles remain popular in the market, more people are attracted by the invention of the electric cars, thus more of both kinds are produced as time goes by. Therefore, it is not too surprising to think of the fact that the carbon footprint will only rise instead of fall. 
<br><br>
The conclusion to be made is that we should not be focusing to change the middle part of the production line of cars, which is an endless path of re-engineering, but we should be focusing on cutting the start of the line, which is manufacturing. In order to do that, we need to completely change consumers’ mindset and taste, which is much more difficult to achieve.
<br><hr>
I agree with your comment. When electric cars started to come out and become more well-known I thought it was way better to get an electric car instead of a regular car. While watching the lecture I was extremely shocked to find out that the production of electric cars put more emission into the air than regular cars. Electric cars generate half the emissions of their gasoline counterparts, but the production is what makes them worse. I always thought that as the years passed by we would get better and better in technology that we would eventually be able to have cars and other things that help our world instead of hurt it. I believe public transportation needs to be free for everyone and be more available so it will help reduce emissions. It would also reduce traffic and more people will want to use public transportation to get to wherever they need to go. The fact that people from other countries now want to get cars because they have become popular in the United States and the United Kingdom shows that these two countries have a lot of influence, which can be used for good. If these two countries would move forward to help stop climate change they would be able to encourage other countries to do the same. This influence can be used for good, but it’s not.

It is mind boggling that our country has not placed greater importance on public transportation given how many people need to commute every day. Europe should be a clear standard of what needs to be done and how we could operate, yet we just seem to keep everything the same or implement things slowly. I don’t understand how we just can’t get it together and make it happen. Public transportation would be way more appealing if we had clean, electric buses, fast and efficient subways or trains, but instead we just get less parking for cars, terrible beat up streets, and the same buses circulating. It’s frustrating that we can devote the money and resources to improving transportation, but we just choose not to.
<br><br>
I do think that our culture and society has hindered public transportation and our country’s desire to improve it. Why would someone give up their freedom of having their own car just to take a bus that may not be on time, may not be clean, and won’t take them exactly where they need to go all for the sake of helping the environment? Most people would never make that switch unless public transportation had far greater benefits to them personally. Yes, taking public transportation is obviously better for the environment, but most people just don’t care when they are already used to taking their own car. I agree, should we even change our mindset in the US, convincing other countries could prove a daunting task.
  <br><hr>
  I really enjoyed that professor Ken discussed our fixation on automobiles due to the events following WWII. The whole concept of the “American Dream” really affected our ways of living, and—while it may not have been evident at the time—the negative effects seem to have overtaken the positive ones. The US has fewer than 4% of the planet’s population; yet, we have a quarter of the world’s cars. In fact, we have more cars than we have licensed drivers. This is insane. It is illogical, and truly quite wrong. 
 <br><br>

I also really liked Ken’s thought-provoking statement that, while cars signify freedom to some, we should imagine what it would be like to have 3-day weekends, due to the disappeared amount of work that we would have to do in order to afford a car in the first place. This reminded me of when I lived in Copenhagen throughout high school. Everyone there takes public transport. It is no “cooler” to have a car than to simply bike or take the train or bus. Plus, there is a huge tax on automobiles in Denmark, which I think also contributes to the lack of their usage. Since it is going to be extremely difficult to radically alter the perceptions of an entire nation—or, even harder, the whole world—I feel as though putting a much higher price tag on automobiles could help diminish the yearning for them. Furthermore, if we set good foundations for using public transport in place (being “cool” to use public transport, saving expenses, widespread accessibility), the switch from personal vehicles to public transport could go a lot more smoothly. 
 <br><br>

I strongly agree with Ken that the copious amounts of time and money that have gone into the development of “green” cars was a waste; not only is it not much of a help toward climate change, but it deters from the real issue at hand. It permits the idealization that we can combat climate change without making any sort of lifestyle changes, which is simply untrue. I feel as though technological advances are just a means of avoiding making real (and difficult) changes to our ways of living. 
 <br><br>

I really liked Ken’s quote: “we should instead have been focusing our attention on re-engineering the cultural practice of car use”. I completely agree with this statement; we need to shift our views on public transportation. We need to make public transport the new norm, the “cool” way to get around. If public transportation was thought about the way that cars are currently viewed, we would emit SIGNIFCANTLY less CO2 into our atmosphere, without having to make much of a drastic change at all. In fact, if public transportation became the most desirable means of transport, the change would not even be difficult; it would be simple, as everyone would think that it is the best means of transport, which it quite arguably is.

 I found this lecture really insightful. I was very much under the impression that electric cars are the future. However, after watching the lecture and taking in what we have discussed over all I think that public transportation is the most environmentally safe as well as easier way to go. As professor Hiltner pointed out cars are expensive, dangerous and increase our CO2 emissions. I agree with professor Hiltner that the big issue is our cultural practices and beliefs about cars. I think in order to fix this we need to change the way we see cars as well as make taking public transportation more appealing. I think America could take some tips from Amsterdam. In Amsterdam there is a very large biking culture, with over 300 miles of bike paths. Amsterdam is the worlds second most bike friendly city, with Copenhagen being the first. It is set up so that biking is almost more efficient then getting around on cars. Considering so many people in America live in rural towns and have to commute to work this might be difficult. However, if more Americans lived closer to work then maybe the culture around cars could change. I am optimistic that there is a shifting trend towards this “eco-culture” that professor Hiltner has pointed out. I personally have seen many of my friends switch to using public transportation to commute to work. I agree that technology alone is not the answer to climate change but that we really need to rethink the cultural practices that define much of the United States. With cars putting out more of a carbon footprint then houses it only makes sense that as a society we need to change the way we use cars. I find it not surprising that in order to keep the economy moving large corporations and industrialization needed to convince the American public to buy into cars. This came at a great expense of planet earth. This comes to no surprise considering in class we have talked a lot about the role of large corporations and how they rely heavily on fossil fuels. To stay in business these corporations will go to great lengths to convince everyone that they need a car. I think they are now using eco friendly cars as a way to keep this going while still marketing to people that are worried about the planet.

 Hearing how much an electric car actually emits is extremely shocking to me, because as I've grown up I've assumed that the best way to help the environment would be to buy an electric car, but now that doesn't seem like it would do too much. What really struck me was the fact that manufacturing an electric car produces between 15 to 68 percent more greenhouse gases than a normal gasoline-fueled car. Even though the electric car emits less gas on the road, how much of that actually balances out with its manufacturing emission. Definitely not as much as is advertised.  
<br><br>
The biggest solution to better allocating our CO2 allotment would be to start making public transportation possible for many states and countries. After visiting Indiana during Christmas break, my boyfriend informed me that their new public bus system was brand new and surprising due to the lack of state taxes. In California, it's pretty easy to put funding towards public transportation because of the high state taxes that we pay. Another factor that plays into the transportation system is the locality of the city center or suburban neighborhoods. Some people don't realize that public transportation isn't reasonable in some rural areas where people are spread out, not only from either other but from marketplaces. In those situations, how much fuel would buses use up without even transporting more than 5 people, and having to go out of their way just to pick up certain people? I truly don't believe that we can completely get rid of cars, but I do believe that we can make a shift to more public transportation.

I agree with this comment. I believe that cars will always be a prominent part of american culture just because people are obsessed with this freedom and convenience regardless of its effects. Yet I do believe that people can shift towards mass transportation as it is more economically beneficial and because in cities people don’t need cars. Cities are a very good idea for living as it is very efficient due to the mass transportation and small housing with apartments and such. Anyway, I was also surprised about how much carbon it takes to produce electric cars because I always thought of them as a very good alternative to driving, and also my dad has also recently bought one and was super excited that it was helping the earth.  I honestly don’t know if I have the heart to tell him that his car may be causing more harm to the earth than mine. Furthermore mass transportation being available to more people would be great for the earth as more people would probably choose to do so as it helps save money and also is quite convenient if it is easily accessible. I live in Texas and the mass transportation there is okay, but definitely could be improved upon, and also could be better advertised and taken care of. The mass transportation there is not too well known about really, I mean I’ve only used it once or twice, and both of those times it was quite ugly and not too taken care of.  If Texas put more effort into it I believe it would become a huge plus, yet I do believe Dallas is pretty good about mass transportation. But yes, more accessible mass transportation would be very beneficial, but I dont think cars can be phased out of our culture.

 This lecture really put things into perspective. I was, like many, under the impression that owning an electric car such as a Tesla or at least a hybrid meant I would be doing something good for the planet. Although compared to the average fuel-consuming car, a Tesla would be a better alternative, I did not realize that simply owning one and going about your daily life would still exceed the limit of two tons of carbon dioxide emissions per person per year.
<br><br>
I definitely support the idea of adopting public transportation such as buses, trains, and subways to get from place to place. However, I see a big problem with this because in cities such as San Jose (where I’m from) and even here in Santa Barbara, these “wonder technologies” as Ken puts it are not prevalent enough to make traveling to the grocery store or work convenient. Waiting for and then taking the bus is time-consuming, not to mention unpleasant when your morning commute is interrupted by a drunk homeless man or spent trying to balance your coffee in one hand and breakfast in the other while standing in a cramped moving vehicle. 
<br><br>

When I went to Germany two summers ago, I remember marveling at the widespread and efficient transportation. Buses came frequently and could take me to school and the supermarket; high-speed trains could take me from one major city to the next in only a few hours; and there was a designated space on sidewalks for bicycles that made me feel safe, unlike back home where I had to be on high alert for any reckless drivers that might drift into the bike lane and run me over. I remember returning home and wondering why we were so behind in transportation like that. It's not only convenient, but it would benefit the environment greatly if we relied less on cars.
<br><br>

So yes, I agree, if possible, we should bike or take public transportation to work, school, and wherever else we need to go to. But the progress our country (or at least, San Jose) is making is incredibly slow and making it difficult to encourage carbon dioxide-reducing behavior. In San Jose, they’ve been working on building a new BART station for at least ten years now. I don’t remember the last time there wasn’t BART construction right by my neighborhood, even though they promised to open the station years ago. Unless the public transportation industry can produce more methods of transportation more quickly, I find it really difficult to adapt to a public transportation-centered lifestyle.

The bus situation you mentioned is also a similar thought that came to my mind. Public transportation of any kind isn't used in my city of Bakersfield by anyone I have ever known. The most common reason is it can be unsafe especially if you have anything to do at night. Taking the bus here was my first time and like you said it is not very convenient. I happened to use the bus this past weekend and I remember a woman getting angry at the bus driver due to the bus being late. My friends and I always talk about how much easier it would be if we had our car, but that's just not an option for many people. I feel like our country is behind the times on efficient transportation on purpose. America loves to spend money on cars and luxuries as much as the big companies love receiving it. I honestly think if the cities and government put more money into making public transportation easier and safer, it would become a trend.
<br><br>
With that being said the stigma of not having a car is way more worse and is something that affects everyone. I have met people who are embarrassed because they don't have their license or feel bad about the car they are driving. I've also known people who don't want to date someone without a car. This is a shame considering cars like a Toyota Prius emit 17 metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere.Additionally, the more efficient cars like Tesla are out of reach for anyone who isn't rich. The population of this planet is largely at fault like Ken said. It is unbelievable to me that our love for social status has also caused the downfall of our planet. What I've learned in this class the impact of changing our personal lives to better this planet means a lot more than most people think. Even just having a conversation with friends or family can have potential to spread and make such a difference.

It’s crazy to see how other countries have such different and much more innovative forms of public transportation. When we compare the much of the infrastructure of the United States to the infrastructure of the rest of the world, much of it is outdated. That is very shocking when you consider how many people rely on public transportation for their day to day activities. In places like New York, where taking the subway is one of the best methods of transportation compared to cars, yet the MTA has constantly failed commuters. Politicians in New York have run with one of their main issues being the desperate need for improvement in the MTA. Now, many New Yorkers are protesting the fees that are being charged because many of them rely on using the subway system multiple times a day throughout the week. That is another thing that should be considered–public transportation should be free. 
<br><br>
The importance that society has placed on material items has led to the lack of investment in public transportation. Instead of investing in public transportation, states are now investing in expanding highways and interstates. Driving up to Santa Barbara from San Diego, I have seen the construction that is occurring on the 101 for the past five years, yet no considerable progress has been made.
 <br><hr>
 I had a similar reaction to you in regards to public transportation being so far behind in the U.S. as opposed to countries such as Germany. Like you, I live in the Bay Area and have grown up mystified by the fact that an area at the center of technological development and climate activism relies on BART and other dysfunctional public transportation options. Listening to this lecture, I want to be able to follow Ken's recommendation and completely remove cars from my life but it is simply not a viable option at this time. Theoretically, to make removing cars from the road and reducing production by a considerable amount, we would have to completely alter the infrastructure of the United States. It is the unfortunate, undeniable truth that our country is largely built around the automobile and that it is hardly realistic to even consider the possibility of such change without a massive change in culture and sudden political will to devote an inordinate amount of money to completely re-engineering our country's infrastructure. For this reason, I was slightly dismissive of this lecture and I think approaching the issue from a slightly different perspective could be more productive in the real world. While I usually respect revolutionary ideas, and I understand we are facing an unprecedented crisis, simply stating that all cars release greenhouse gases is not productive. The same reasoning used in this lecture, that the production of anything at all is worse than not producing anything, can be applied to everything. For instance, is the production of vegan burgers better than beef? Yes. Is there still an environmental impact? Yes, but that does not mean that we should deride the production of it. Compromise is ok, and I think it is unrealistic to expect people to completely remove cars from their life. Therefore, I think it is still laudable to buy an electric car instead of a gas one since the environmental impact will be less. Also, dismissing people's efforts to change their lifestyle and do what they can to help the environment is counterproductive, as it does not encourage more people to take whatever action they can. Encouraging people to do more is necessary for this time, but we also need to be able to celebrate even the smallest of steps to make sure more people will start contributing to solving this crisis.


<br><hr>
I had the same understanding about these new innovative cars as well before this lecture. It really put into perspective how uninformed the public must be by this as well. As consumers, we tend to accept what is being told to us by vendors, we will only hear what they want us to know unless we look for the answers ourselves. Although these new cars do not meet the goal of the paris accords, these differences still mark a huge progress of car manufacturing in improving greenhouse gas emissions being released into the atmosphere.

    Just like cars, public transportation has its downfalls which may raise questions and objections from the public when suggesting turning into a car-free world. Personally, I have never owned a car and have always depended on carpooling or public transportation. Riding a bus may not be the ideal thing to do as it can be dangerous and inconvenient, however, I believe using public transportation has also led to me becoming more responsible and more aware of my surroundings as I do not have “freedom” to go where I want, when I want, with who I want. Public transportation has also led to me meeting and interacting with new people all with different backgrounds which would not happen if I were to own a car. Going to a destination may be a hassle, but it has led me to be more organized as I plan my days to make time to go grocery shopping, visiting a city, going to class, etc. Not only am I attaining better life skills but I am also contributing to a greener environment.

    If markets today continue making progress in less CO2 emissions in the production and use of cars in response to the climate crisis it would definitely make a big difference. However, cultural changes are more important in minimizing these emissions as well. The more changes we can make to our lifestyles will lead to faster technological innovation can evolve and reducing emissions would happen at a much faster rate. Changing your lifestyle can be really difficult but living the same way for years seems more dull.

 I’m for every adjustment that’ll help climate change, but when it comes to cars, I don’t have the same hope. Switching from cars to public transportation can be extremely difficult especially in noncity areas. I just don’t see the human population straying away from car use. If anything, kids are getting cars as soon as they’re legally able to. In places like smaller college towns, like SB, or bigger cities, we can increase our public transportation use to make up for rural and the more difficult places. Places where it’s more accessible will have a likelier higher use or willingness to convert.  
<br><br>
I remember as a little kid flying cars was a common futuristic thing but I honestly don’t see that coming true for the future of cars. I would think the future of cars would a more advanced tesla type vehicle. Self-driving would be more common but nothing too extreme. I think with everything there’s always a “greener” option, so as cars become more advanced, I believe something else “greener” will also become popular. Technological innovations have had a big impact over the last decade. Technology has allowed us to live freely. So many companies and technologies have gone “smart”. From housing to tv, to lifestyles, new innovations have made it as easy to control within fingertips. As of right now, I think technology is helping more than hurting our environment but too much of anything isn’t healthy.

I completely agree with your perspective. Innovation is at the heart of the American dream, and cars are seen as in terms as part of that success. I highly doubt that any social change will be able to transform this ideology, however this doesn't mean I am completely pessimistic about the future of reducing carbon emissions emitted by the transportation industry. For example, when I was in China I learned how they give out their licenses for cars based on a lottery, which means people are forced to carpool or use other forms of transportation until they can get a legal driving licenses. Furthermore, in some cities, cars with certain license plate numbers are allowed to drive on certain days which forces people to carpool with others to reduce the traffic on the roads and furthermore the carbon emissions. If this process could be implemented in suburban cities then society would eventually begin to look towards carpooling, and public transportation first, before investing in their own vehicles. Another idea that I believe would be effective in minimizing the amount of one person occupied cars on the road is giving some sort of compensation to those who choose to carpool. Whether this would be a tax ride off, or other form of monetary encouragement this could be successful since a majority of society is money driven and won't consider changing their lifestyle habits if not directly benefitted. There are a lot of steps to take to ease into the conversation of society stepping away from car ownership, however to outright demand this kind of dramatic change completely discredits your argument due to how unrealistic it is. For the future of these discussions, I believe there needs to be an inclusion of less dramatic alternatives, which will allow for a period of acclimation before jumping into the dramatic changes that are necessary to save the environment. 
<br><br>
However you also made a valid claim in your response about the future of innovation. There are so many alternatives that innovative technological advancements can provide to society instead of cars, that is if given the proper funding and public support required. The first step to helping the climate crisis, is climate consciousness. Once the general public is aware of the small steps they can take to reduce their emissions, then the conversation can begin of the necessity to transform our consumer culture into a more eco-concious one.

 After watching Professor Ken’s lecture video “Why the climate crisis is a cultural problem,” I realized that changing our car use is far more important than switching to electric cars. In the long run, it will benefit us more if we change the way we use transportation than trying to find new ways to create cars that make less carbon emission. Even though electric cars create less carbon emission than regular cars do when used over time, I found it surprising that it creates more carbon emission when manufacturing them. I think that in order to lessen the carbon emission created from cars we need to change the way we view public transportation. As mentioned in the lecture video, New York is an example of a place where people live freely without their automotive vehicles and where public transportation is highly supported and encouraged. If more people start to use public transportation, there will be more places like New York. Even though there are some inconveniences that come with using public transportation, such as waking up earlier to get to a destination, overall, it would be more beneficial. Moreover, people would be spending less money on gas and it will have a positive impact on our environment.

I agree with your comment. I thought it was interesting how electric cars don’t help as much as I thought they did. It all seemed like it was going to work like a miracle and help the CO2 emission problems decrease when electric cars came out but little do we know about how these cars are made. Unfortunately, there is more Co2 emitted when making these cars that the average car emits out in the streets. I think the easiest and most beneficial way to help our environment would be to decrease our driving habits instead of buying electric cars. Not only would it help our environment, but it would help our health and wallets as well, as Ken explained in the lecture. I definitely think if we encouraged public transportation more, it’d be beneficial to everyone. As of now, I think many people refuse to use public transportation because it isn’t thought of as “cool” by the general public. But if America could sponsor buses the way they sponsor cars and show everyone the benefits of using public modes of transportation, I think it would make a big difference. Like Ken explained, science can explain the data of how fast we’re killing the planet, but humanities can explain why. Additionally, psychology can tell us why society is prone to spending money on cars, but also tell us how we can change that. Hopefully this generation can change societal norms and work together for the greater good of this planet.

 After watching the lecture video “Why the climate crisis is a cultural problem,” I came to the realization that our society’s obsession with technologically progressing may not be that solution to climate change. I was initially shocked to hear that electronic cars are simply not the right answer. This is due to the enormous amount of carbon emission released from manufacturing the cars themselves. The real solution is cutting out or at least reducing car use overall from our lives. Instead, we need to invest in public transportation to make it more appealing to the general public. However, I can see how this would seem unappealing initially to the public since it does seem like a downgrade. For instance, people would no longer be able to simply leave to their destination at any desirable time nor would they be able to head directly there without interruption. This is why public transportation time needs to be improved by having more options available. For example, here in Goleta, I utilize the buses often because they run very frequently. In addition, there is no negative stigma herein using the bus since most students do use it. On the other hand, back at home and other places in the US, public transportation is seen as inferior. Overall, to prevent further release of more than 2 metric tons of carbon per year, we must stop our society’s fixation with automobiles.

The focus on producing electric cars and by a wider extent, "eco-friendly" goods to combat the climate crisis is really just another example of how American consumerism and capitalism creep into every aspect of our lives. Trying to rely on technology, and specifically the production of technology like electric cars to expand the market will not solve the climate crisis. Like you and Ken said, manufacturing cars has an incredible carbon footprint in and of itself. I'd argue that saying "get an electric car and use it less" is already a moot point, because of the carbon released during production. I agree when you say that public transportation options need to be expanded to mimic the convenience of personal vehicles, and to combat the stigma that public transportation is only for inferior people. It isn't an easy fix, but assuming that the mobile American (and now international) lifestyle will not change, public transportation needs to be the transportation of the future.

 Since coming to UCSB, I pat myself on the back for getting around town without a car. I thought coming to college without a car would be inconvenient. However, I’ve found the opposite. I’ve taken the bus countless times to Downtown Santa Barbara because of the convenience; the cost is free, the bus picks me up a 5 minute walk from my dorm, and I get to socialize with my friends the entire way there and back without the stress of having to follow directions. Additionally, I took an Amtrak for the first time in Southern California to visit my brother; the Surfliner is beautiful as the train moves along the coast, especially at sunset, and although taking a train is longer than driving, it’s a lot better than sitting in hours of LA traffic. The best part is never paying for gas!!
<br><br> 
A few summers ago, I travelled to Sydney, Australia with my family, and I was blown away by their public transportation system. I was able to get all over Sydney and the surrounding area by ferry, train, subway, and bus. My family and I were perfectly able to figure out their transportation systems with ease, and I noticed how many businessmen and businesswomen commuted on public transit to get to and from work. The difference between Sydney and a city like New York was the cleanliness and prices. The trains were spotless, and stations were well-kept. I think if America could develop similar cheap, cleanly, and convenient transportation systems, a lot more people would consider ditching cars and using buses and trains.

Thank you for sharing your experience and things you see related to use of cars and buss from you hometown and countries you have travelled to. I also take a lot of public transportation a lot no matter if I am in San Francisco or SB which are the places with convenient public transportation. And you are right, sometimes taking bus or trains can also be very convenient plus the costs are cheaper.
<br><br>
I personally don’t drive but my family does. However, everytime when we go out, we will all be sitting in the same car instead of driving two seperate one. Which I think is something can be more environmentally friendly 
<br><br>
And I totally agree with what you have said about the cleanliness and prices. If the public transportation are clean and comfortable and cheap enough, a lot more people living in that place will be willing to take public transportation more instead of driving.

 After watching the lecture video I was really surprised to see that electric cars are not much better than cars powered by gasoline in terms of their carbon footprint on the planet and the amount of carbon dioxide emitted during their production. I never knew that the production of automobiles could result in such a huge amount of carbon emission that even a regular average car like the Toyota Prius would release 17 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, not to mention the large popular SUVs that can produce two times as much carbon emission to as much as 35 metric tons. 
<br><br>


Before watching this lecture I had always thought that the major cause of automobiles’ carbon emission comes from the actual operation and driving of the automobiles after the cars are produced and sold to the customers, and I had never imagined that the process of manufacturing automobiles would result in such a significant amount of carbon emission. Additionally, at the beginning of the lecture, Ken mentioned that in order to address the climate crisis and minimize our carbon footprint on the environment, we should each emit no more than 2 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent gases every year. That might sound like a really huge number, but it really is not a whole lot if we include every aspect of our lives and calculate the corresponding carbon emission with each aspect, such as food, clothing, transportation, and more. What again shocked me was the fact that Ken brought up in the video, which was that this recommended level of carbon dioxide emission of our entire lifetime, 2 metric tons per year, is easily being used when we purchase a new car for every eleven years and just park them in the garage and never drive them. This might sound like a crazy statistics but it is the harsh truth, and it goes again to show the enormous negative impact of cars and automobiles on our planet that they can produce so much harmful carbon emission into the atmosphere, yet we still cannot get rid of it because our culture is so in love with it that the ownership of a car is equivalent to a higher socio-economic position and status. 
<br><br>


When I was halfway through the video, I was shocked and disappointed at, firstly with the devastating negative environmental impacts of automobiles and secondly with our modern society’s obsession with automobiles that it becomes such a central and integral part of our lives and cultures that our lives would completely dysfunction without them. Cars and automobiles should just be the tool that we use to make transportation and traveling more convenient and easier, but we end up relying so much on them that we are overly dependent upon automobiles as a result of automobiles constituting such a huge part of our daily routines and lives. However, are we doomed with our codependence on automobiles? Is there really no way out for us humans in regard to our means of transportation? The answer, as Ken provided in the lecture video, is no, we are not, and there is a really simple way to solve the issues brought by automobiles: public transportations. In fact, public transportation, including buses, trains, and subways, is so much more efficient compared to automobiles because of their far greater capacity that they can transport many more people with the same amount of gasoline that a privately-owned automobile would use to transport one single person or only a few people. Since they can transport more people using the same or less amount of gasoline than that of automobiles, public transportation is much more environmentally-friendly and beneficial to our environment and would assist us in alleviating the climate crisis. 
<br><br>


Furthermore, despite how beneficial and advantageous public transportation is to our environment and to solve the climate crisis, a majority of Americans are still reluctant to give it a try and are still much relying upon their personal automobiles. The root cause for this phenomenon, again, comes from the advertisements made by the automobile industry promoting the concept that driving cars is cool, convenient, and gives people more freedom and that public transportation is not as fast or cool in comparison. From my interpretation, this concept is only partially true because the public transportation systems in some cities and areas are actually not as fast or convenient because of the significantly less amount of federal and state funding they receive as the automobile industry lobbies politicians and policymakers to increase funding and favor the automobile industry. 
<br><br>


Nevertheless, this reality does not mean that we should completely give up on public transportation because we should bring public transportation back into public attention and to encourage public support for public transportation. Just like Ken mentioned in the lecture video, we need to make the public know that public transportation is just as cool and convenient as driving automobiles. More importantly, the public needs to realize that by making the decision to take public transportation instead of driving privately-owned automobiles, they are indeed doing themselves, their children, their future descendants, and the entire humanity a favor as this is an environmentally-conscious action that would reduce their carbon footprint on the environment and therefore contribute to the solution of the climate crisis and the making of a more healthy, balanced planet.

 This lecture has been the most eye opening one I have watched so far in this class. I was shocked by how right Ken was. WHY ARE CARS SO COOL? I don’t know, I don’t even like cars that much and I still love cars. My confusion was quickly answered, because that is what companies want. The major car industries are so successful, if you were to ask someone of any age “what is your dream car?” I promise you they will have a quick answer and majority will have multiple “dream cars”. But this is what is wrong with our culture. I was amazed that we have ¼ of the worlds cars and that we have more cars than people with driver's licenses. The issue is I need to stop being shocked, because every issue hurting our planet is disproportionately caused by the United States. 
<br><br>
Though this video has not prevented me from thinking about my dream car, it has me second guessing it. Why would I want to spend $9,000 a year so that I can “look cool” or “feel successful”. This video has left me with so many questions regarding the choices I make when I do get a job. This is where I think what if I live in a town that I need a car. In my hometown there is no form of useful bus system. We do not even have school busses… 
<br><br>
Another factor that really made me think that technology is not the answer. I knew that lifestyle choices are a big part of reducing our CO2 emissions, but I did not know it was to this point. The idea that we could live our lives emitting 2 metric tons of CO2 annually by leaving our car in the driveway for 11 years made me take a step back. It made me realize that we not only need to promote public transport, but we must demand it culturally. But this is something I think will be incredibly hard to do, because people believe technology can save us.

I had the same exact reaction to this lecture. I am very guilty of the American worship of cars. I have pretty much defined success with the the purchasing of my dream car, which coincidentally is a Tesla. Now after having watched this lecture I too am begging to second guess a that goal of mine. Having grown up in Los Angeles, where it feels as if cars pretty much outnumber people, cars are just a part of our everyday lives. About 8 years ago my dad had lost his job and he had been dealt with car issues, it was then that I had first realized the dependence that we have on our cars. Americans see cars as a top necessity in our lives and as Ken pointed out in this lecture they don’t need to be. Our materialistic culture and media makes us to make a see success as a direct correlation to our material items, and I am guilty of participating. 
<br><br>
  The changes to our lifestyle although drastically important still sound idealistic. Picturing a United States where cars aren’t dominating transportation is hard to do. I can’t even picture my parents voluntarily taking a train or bus to work instead of driving. Usually Americans being inconvenienced doesn’t sit well and for these reasons I am not very optimistic for out future concerning our cars.
<br><hr>

I also agree that this lecture video has been the most startling out of all of the videos I've watched yet. Most people I know have a car, and love them as if they were a living being. I, on the other hand, do not have a car. Although it is sometimes annoying not being able to drive myself place to place, I am glad that I do not have one. First off, having to maintain a car can be a hassle and a pricey task. Just as Ken had mentioned in his video, one saves around $9,000 a year by not owning a car. My hometown does not have any public transportation either, but there is Uber, and I do use the app occasionally. When it comes to going to and from school to hometown, I take the Santa Barbara Airbus. It is relatively cheap and offers a very comfortable and quiet atmosphere where you can do homework or just enjoy the view along the way. For anyone reading this comment, if you live in Los Angeles, the bus takes you right to LAX. I would definitely recommend taking the Airbus as it is cheaper for yourself, and cleaner for the environment. This video has made me question whether or not I will buy a car in the future. It may sound silly to many people, but if you take the climate crisis seriously it must be done. I think this decision will be based on what kind of job I have in the future. If I do choose to commit to work early in the morning, and there is no public transportation, I will most likely buy a car. Hopefully, by the time I am looking to buy a car, producing an electric vehicle will not emit as much greenhouse gas as it does now. I will probably end up buying some sort of electrically powered vehicle as it is safer for the environment. I also think the rest of my generation will acquire electronically powered vehicles as it is cleaner for the environment. Owning a Tesla, or any other sort of electronic car is becoming a fad. This is a good thing considering electric vehicles emit fewer greenhouse gases compared to diesel-fueled cars over time.

I think the fact that we are rethinking cars is a step in the right direction. In all I think this shows how much America thinks of cars as a necessity like you said. It is horrible how we struggle to try and pay for something like a car when in reality if there was better alternative transportation they would not be necessary. I agree that everyone is so connected to materials as well. It is not only the culture of Americans but also people from LA. Everyone in LA wants to have the nicest car which I agree would make taking buses to work harder. But I do think if it got very efficient because there is a lot of traffic it could be a possibility. Like in the video of the cities Ken presented buses had their own lanes and would get places way faster than cars. I think this is the only chance LA would have in order to see change. For now this idea will have to be spread in hope that one day society agrees.
<br><hr>
I agree that having a car especially once you turn 16 is a normal thing in America. But it is very costly at $9,000 a year seems ridiculous. I agree that uber as well is a great way of getting around when you do not have a car, which is what I do here. Especially because a lot of ubers are often priuses and not huge SUVs. I have also heard of the airbus and thought of taking it because when I go back to LA I often have to go in a car with one other person. But now knowing that buses get 14 times more miles to the gallon, it will be a better choice for next time. I agree that when I graduate and know these facts I will have a hard time. The fact is in LA there is no way I could get around without a car. So I agree I will try to get an electric car because at least it is a little better, but still not the solution. Another thing that is better about Teslas that I have learned is that when they come out with a new technology for it, you can get it on the older modle. You do not have to get a new car, the older cars can do the same functions which is really good!

 Ken brought up the fact that making one car and having sit on your driveway for 10 or 11 years is already 2 metric tons of CO2. This is something I never knew or ever thought of. I had always thought it was what the car had emitted and it never crossed my mind that it takes a lot of energy and resources to create just 1 car. I had always assumed that electric vehicles such as a Tesla or Hybrid would the way to go if we wanted to save the environment and reverse the climate crisis. This is not the case though. Car culture is such a huge part of not only American lives but lives in all cultures throughout the whole world. Continuing g to use and produce cars will get us nowhere in helping the Earth. Car culture is so embedded into all of our minds across the world it would take years and years in order to get people to stop using cars and to start using public transportation. 
<br><br>
Throughout my entire life before coming to UCSB, I was led to believe that taking the bus wasn’t cool or others saw someone taking the bus would just assume that person was poor. Coming to UCSB it made me realize the bus is perfectly normal and thee is nothing wrong with it. Buses are economically friendly and they do not cause as much emission due to the fact lots of people are riding in them. No one should frown upon someone taking the bus or other means of public transportation because there is no problem with it.

I agree with your comments too, and I also thought that electric vehicles would be there to pave the way to reduce carbon gas emissions and help solve the climate crisis. Ken has convinced me that if we truly want to make an impact that can solve this problem, we should do away with cars and instead focus on using public transportation like buses, subways, and trains. These forms of public transportation can take many people at a much lower carbon emission rate, and I truly believe that this can be a significant change toward lowering our carbon footprint. We need to stop believing that having and driving cars is cool and rather focus on that it is so much better to save the planet by taking the bus. I never knew that just making one car, and not even driving it, for 10-11 years is already emitting 2 metric tons of CO2. This just emphasizes how much CO2 we emit by driving cars every day and that we should not only stop driving them but also stop producing them. I am convinced that if we prioritized public transportation over cars, we can first create a significant decrease in our carbon footprint, then start we can mitigate and eventually stop the current climate crisis.

The problem with our current situation is that people live in the suburbs and have to commute long distances every day to get to their place of work. A lot of cities don't have consistent or fast public transportation to get from the suburbs to the city and vice versa. For me, a one hour drive to Los Angeles would take 2 hours on the train. Trains sometimes don't run at the right times and, for some people, it removes a sense of privacy that you get in a car.

<br><Br>
When Americans think of public transportation, they think of that which occurs within a city. What really needs to be improved is that which goes from the suburbs to the city. Many cities have already implemented rentable bikes and scooters (such as limes or birds) which allow people to get from place to place much quicker than a bus would be sitting in traffic. I think this would be a better solution than promoting a bus system which, to some, seems un-cleanly and un-private.
<br><Br>

A solution Ken has mentioned for this problem is having people move to the cities, which to me is unlikely. People like their quiet, suburban homes. They're big, safe, and away from all the madness that goes on in the big cities. It's easy to raise children in this less hectic environment. If somehow everyone flocked back to the cities to live, people wouldn't have to drive as much and thus would emit less. However, I think too many problems arise with this solution. With the amount of people that would be living in these cities, diseases would run rampant. Big cities are already having difficulties maintaining their cleanliness, and adding more people will not make their jobs any easier.

 This was an interesting lecture for me to listen to because I have actually done research on electric cars and their impact on the environment. Another factor that many people dont think about with electric cars is how the electricity is produced for these cars. In many cases, especially throughout the United States, this electricity is produced by the burning of coal. While per mile they are not emitting as much CO2, this neutralizes the benefits of buying an electric car when you factor in the manufacturing process. When they are on a clean, renewable energy grid however, electric cars can be an excellent option for consumers who dont have an ability/access to public transportation. 
<br><Br>
 Ultimately the larger issue is Americas distaste of the public transportation system. Throughout the world, metros, busses and train lines are the main form of transportation. America faces an infrastructure problem, where urban sprawl of the 1950’s led to american society being spread out and suburbanized. This makes public transportation far more difficult to implement, but not impossible. Cities around the USA need to find ways to fund public transportation lines, for the economy and for the planet.

I agree that America has a large gap in public transportation. It sucks that America resulted to the reliance of cars instead of trying to implement public transportation. I do agree that the urban sprawl makes it difficult to could create large public transportation, but it's not impossible. The US has accomplished many impossible things in it's history so I'm sure that if they wanted to make public transportation more accessible and efficient, they would.  It's just that they allocate government funds to more "important" things like the military and government officials, which is concerning because accessible transportation would be beneficial to all-- especially large cities and low income communities.

I’m glad you brought up consideration for the electricity generation that actually goes into an electric car. That concern has been the subject of several conversations that I’ve had with my dad, a proud owner of an electric car. While I completely agree that coal-sourced electricity reduces the benefit of driving an electric car, I maintain the perspective that Ken briefly intimated which is that it is still the better option given that you are definitely buying a car. I also agree that our public transit system needs a lot of work, but I think it is worth considering that a socio-cultural movement was really the genesis of our automobile obsession. With that being the case, we need only to generate the same movement in favor of public transportation infrastructure and I sincerely believe that policy and construction would quickly follow.

 The fact mentioned in this lecture shows that even if we buy one car and never use it, we have already reached the maximum amount of CO2 emissions. I was surprised by this fact, since I know that car is an important factor for climate crisis, but I have never thought it is so serious like this. I was thinking about buying a car this summer, but now I don’t… 
<br><Br>
However, it is hard to not own a car, especially in US. The cost of taking Uber is so expensive. Every place is so far away from another. The density of bus route is not that kind of efficient. There is an old saying among us that we have no legs without cars. We cannot go anywhere else, except staying at home. It may be not people really like it for some cultural problem, like the appearance or the esteem it brings. Instead, people really need it. Cars can bring us the convenience and more efficient life.

I agree that it is crazy how much Carbon Dioxide is released when you buy just one car, I never think about how the production of the car is the worst release of greenhouse gases. From Professor Ken's lecture video I realized the importance of having a cultural change, because right now one of the biggest problems facing the world is the production of cars. As 4.6 metric tons per year of CO2 is emitted and one fourth of this comes from the production of cars. 
<br><br>
I can not believe that electric cars are not the solution, I always was told that we would be saved once electric cars came to be but not I realize that cars regardless of whether they are electric or not take tons of CO2 to make. As the average American should only submit two CO2 metrics a year. I think it is crazy that China increased its use of cars by 10,000 percent because that is just insane and scary. I think people really need to turn their attention to trains and other forms of mass transportation to save gas and the emission of CO2. I think that the future of cars hopefully is that we will stop using them and just use mass transportation.

 I really like the main message of Ken’s lecture this week and it’s something that really stuck with me and forced me to think. While public concern over climate change has grown in the 21st Century, there has been little, relatively speaking, change that has occured. Ken really hit a fascinating point that I agree with regarding technology’s role in this. It seems like there is some innate view held by a lot of people that technology alone will save us from a looming climate catastrophe. People point to innovators like Elon Musk and others as our saviors, but it is not right to place the responsibility of saving our planet entirely on those people because that is not enough. We need to start taking an inward look at ourselves and our culture, and we need to address any issues we find as a community. 
<br><br>
The example of cars in America used by Ken is a really good starting point. Not only are cars costly, inefficient, and dangerous, there are cheaper, safer, and more environmentally friendly modes of transport that we can adopt like trains or buses. These alternatives are not new forms of technology, but the overall American public refuses to adopt them into their lives. Cars are something ingrained in our culture from NASCAR to car shows and more, and I don’t know how we can change this, but it starts on an individual level. We have to abandon this idea that someone will come save us, because the blame is on all of us if we have alternatives and we don’t adopt them.

I agree that we need to make a conscious shift in our lifestyles and not rely on technological advances to save us. At the end of the day, if we don't make the necessary changes because we are too comfortable in our current lives, we will ultimately destroy the planet. I didn't understand how important trains and other methods of public transportation were until after watching this video, the fact that it reduces the consumption of gas to just four gallons per person is insane! I just wish it was seen as a more viable way of transportation, I feel as though it is very hard for me to access a lot of these. I tried to take the train home a while ago and as a broke college student, I couldn't afford the $60 price tag.

<br><Br>
I think it's going to be hard to switch people to public transportation. It's so convenient and readily available in cities like New York because the city is so compact. With urban sprawl and the invention of suburbs, things are so spread out that it's nearly impossible to get anywhere without a car. I feel like we're on the right track with Lyft and Uber, as the carpooling is better, but I think improved buses/readily available bus schedules and taxes on cars are a good start. I hate that having a car is seen as such an achievement, getting your license at 16 and being gifted a brand new car is a right of passage for most Americans. My car is a hand-me-down, it was my grandma's, and while it's a pain in the ass most times, I'm grateful for continuing to use it until it no longer functions. 
<br><br>

As a culture, Americans need to wake up and realize that cars aren't everything and that we can express ourselves/our wealth in different ways!

 This lecture video was extremely helpful when considering the pros and cons of buying a car in today’s climate. I have two conflicting stances when it comes to this issue. On one hand, I believe that cars are taking an incredible toll on the environment and are contributing to the largest portion of an American’s carbon footprint. On the other hand, I believe there are certain instances that absolutely require on to have a car.

<br><br>
Cars are contributing to too much of our carbon footprint. If I heard correctly, Ken said that it accounts for a quarter of our yearly carbon footprint, and that’s not including production, just usage. He also said that three-quarters of cars have only one person in them at a time. This is absolutely mind-boggling when you think about it. Even electric cars, though they are better than traditional gasoline operated cars, are taking their own toll on the environment. This brings us to the culture of cars in America. The only way to stop this epidemic is to end this culture of cars that as ravaged America, but to be quite frank I don’t think it’s possible. To some, it is so ingrained within their perspective of life that the very thought of not having a car is either not present or too outlandish to even consider. To others, a car is an absolute necessity, such as if they have to commute through suburbs or their location of work is in a particularly inaccessible location by public transport. Others, such as women, may feel as though driving is the safest option when considering public transportation because let’s face it, men, especially men on public transportation, consistently make women feel uncomfortable or make unwanted advances. Why subject themselves to that when they could have a comfortable, safe method of travel with them at all times. Whatever the case may be, it still stands that cars have their practical benefits that simply cannot be attained by public transportation
<br><br>

Regardless, I do believe public transportation is the transportation of the future. Ken mentioned high-speed trains offer about 730 miles to the gallon, and buses about 300. They also have the added bonus of not having to deal with driving oneself, and they are considerably safer accident-wise than driving. I saw a post the other day on Twitter than detailed plans to build a nationwide high-speed rail system. The environmental benefits of such a thing would be astounding, not to mention the practical convenience of not having to drive oneself or take a plan when you want to travel across the country. The only drawback I see is the possible destruction of certain ecosystems during the construction of the tracks, but if an environmentally friendly method was proposed, I would be one thousand percent on board.

The points that you brought up were very interesting to me. When I was watching the video, I felt as if I didn’t want to listen to what Ken was saying. I know that cars, and planes are very bad for the environment, so I try to reduce the amount I use them. However, I have always told myself or reassured myself that isn’t that bad to use them. However, Kens video really opened my eyes to the mass amounts of CO2 that these cars use in even just their production. Cars are so easy. You don’t have to wait on anyone else, you can stick to your schedule, you can go directly to your desired location, you don’t have to stop to drop anyone else off. This is where I agree with you. I think it is going to be very hard if almost impossible to eliminate cars, especially from America. As we have seen often Americans don’t do anything unless it is easier for them, even if it is more environmentally friendly or economically sustainable. We have developed a way of life that is so dependent on cars and taking us from place to place. In order change people and cultural views about cars it is going to take some very hard work. (Especially for the people stuck in their ways.)
<br><br> 
As you said I think that public transport can become bigger and more used than cars, but I don’t know If we can completely eliminate cars. One the problem with America is our public transport system. We need to make it easier and faster to have people be able to take a train from state to state, or across the country. We also need to more extensively develop the public transportation in cities. If we do this and find a way to incentive these routes, we might be on the way to getting more people one the public transport bus ;) Possible way that we could do this are really advocating for the climate, explaining to people especially in the more liberal environmentally aware areas like California the benefit of taking mass transit. Tell them that they can get across the country on 4 gallons of gas, and how much that is reducing their carbon footprint. However, this wonk work for all. Someone we need an incentive to make this mode of transport more appealing than driving or flying. Maybe we can do this by making it cheaper, faster, and culturally cool.

 After hearing so many good things about Tesla and their zero-emission electric cars, I decided that my dream car would be a Tesla in order to reduce my carbon footprint while still being able to get around efficiently. It was kind of disappointing to learn the amount of fossil fuels burned to manufacture a single car, especially the fact that just leaving the car unused would still release the entire yearly goal of 2 metric tons of CO2. Watching this lecture made me aware of how naiïve the majority of people are with respect to solving the issue. I had never thought about the problem with cars from a cultural perspective, but after doing so, it’s almost hard to blame our society for its car obsession. From its associations with freedom, to the tendency of always wanting the best and newest new technology, it is no surprise that cars have become such a staple in American society. The car has become one of the main images of the American dream itself. As a result, the demand for parking lots and complex freeways have increased tremendously; these advances in cars consequently reduced the quality of public transportation systems. With the unreliability of public transportation, these methods have come to be associated with low social status. It is even clearer to me now that climate change is not only a scientific issue, but a cultural one that can only be solved by changing the culture itself. Unfortunately, this makes the solution all the more difficult, since that involves 
<br><br>
1. convincing a nation that doesn’t believe in the climate issue to 
<br><br>
2. change their most deeply ingrained habits and customs.
<br><Br>
I truly enjoyed this lecture since it helped me see the climate crisis from a new perspective. However, I hope that you will teach us more tangible ways to bring about social change.

Everywhere I go, there would be a Tesla and everyone would be like “it’s a Tesla!”. Tesla has been well-known as the car to have if you want to reduce carbon footprint. I also thought that having a Tesla would be a good change to the environment because it doesn’t release CO2 into the atmosphere but without Ken telling us that the process of making the car is the environmentally bad thing about it, I wouldn’t have thought about that part. I think I wanted to think that if I have a Tesla, I would reduce carbon footprint because this is a car that doesn’t require gas but now, my opinion has changed.
<br><br>
I also understand Ken’s point about how if we choose to rely on public transportation, walking, or biking, it would be a better alternative than cars but I also feel like cars are just so much more convenient because it’s yours. You don’t have to wait for other people or fight for a spot on the bus. Also, if you have your own car, you know what has been in it and where it has been. There was a video I watched that went viral and it was someone who was hitting the bus seats to see how much dirt accumulated and brown dust were coming out of the seat. This has scarred me because I realized how dirty the bus is and how much people who have bad hygiene has come into contact with the exact same thing as me. I know this could be said for everything but in terms of cars, I feel like if you have your own, it’s just a better feeling. Currently, I do not have my own car and I do walk around in order to get to places but when I go back home, I take rideshare and it’s definitely a better option than flying.

 I think it is great to see the technological changes, because at least people are aware of our environment and are willing to make some changes. However, I didn’t know that the manufacturing of an electric car produces so much more greenhouse gases than a similar gasoline car. Hence, cultural changes will be more effective in improving our environment. I lived in Portland for the past few years, and many Portlanders use the MAX (Metropolitan Area Express) to commute. There are also people who bike or take the bus. I think the overall culture of a particular region really affects the way people behave.

 Before watching this video, I honestly forgot about the production of a car and how those figures can drastically affect our environment. This could be due to the fact that where I come from cars are a must and often times people have multiple cars. The solution to gas emissions that has always been said around my area is that we should cut down the number of cars we use, try to switch to electric or hybrid cars, or try to carpool with someone to work. The focus was always around the amount of gas emissions the car personally made and was said to be our biggest problem. I never realized the amount of gas emissions that are released during the production of a car. The numbers of twenty-two metric tons of gas emissions produced only by creating the car is insane especially when we look at the number we should not go over that Ken talks about; two metric tons per year. I felt disgusted about these numbers because I know of a handful of people I went to high school with, just three years ago, that have two cars for themselves. I always knew it was excessive to have two cars but now it makes me more furious now since I know about how large its gas emission is just for production.
<br><br>
However, I gained some hope when Ken said that there is technology that can get people from Los Angeles to New York City on only four gallons of gas. This sounded amazing and I was shocked that I have never heard of it; that is until I heard it was buses and trains. Now I have nothing against trains or buses but I do have a problem with the system here in the United States. Our public transportation systems can be very unreliable at times which causes it to be not a good option as a mode of transportation to work or school. Japan’s public transportation system is so much better and has an error time for their buses and trains less than two minutes. If the US were to get their system to be as good as Japan I believe that so many more people would be wanting to use public transportation. I believe that until cars become uncool and/or our public transportation system becomes more efficient, people will continue to drive their gas-emitting machines.

While I was watching Ken's lecture, I had the same thought as you -- I never stopped to think about how the production of a car contributes to the climate just as much as driving a car does. I am glad that Ken brought this up because I feel like most people do not realize the effect that production has. As you said, normally you hear people talk about carpooling in order to reduce their emissions, but obviously that is not the main problem here. Instead of taking one car and not two, people need to be taking public transportation to decrease the number of cars manufactured. I am not saying that carpooling not an option, but it seems that the bigger problem lies in the making of a car; if people drive less, then less cars are made. 
<br><br>
What also stuck out to me was the comment that Ken made about cars that sit in the driveway. Even though they are not being driven, they are still emitting carbon dioxide. His comment made me think about the fact that the car I drove in high school is not being driven by my parents; they leave it in the driveway and wait for me to use it or until I bring it here next year. Throughout the course I have been thinking to myself that I am decreasing my carbon footprint since all I do is ride my bike around campus and take the bus when I go off campus. While not using my car has reduced it by a small amount, it is not as much as I realized.
<br><br>

I also agree with you and your point about hope. It is amazing to see that places like Japan have been able to build sustainable and efficient modes of public transportation. Hopefully, one day we will be able to achieve that here in the United States, but until then I agree that most people will continue to drive their cars.

 While Ken was going through his lecture on how much CO2 is put into the air through owning any type of car, I think it's interesting that he goes through and mentions not only the amount of CO2 the car puts out, but how much CO2 it takes to build a car and also break it down again. I agree with Ken, cars are dangerous, they are expensive, they aren’t always practical, and they destroy the planet with the amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases they put out into the atmosphere. The problem isn’t about making a car makes zero carbon emissions, but rather a problem with the thinking and stigma that surrounds cars, especially here in the United States.  It’s no surprise to me that cars are such a big part of our everyday lives. They take us to and from work, school, sports practices, and any other extra curricular things people participate in. Many people, especially those who live in rural and suburban areas, rely on their cars more than anything else. But why? Well it’s like Ken mentioned, the stigma of owning a car is tied in with someone’s freedom to do what they want. Where I live, in a relatively suburban area, the only way to get around was really by car or bus. Everyone looks forward to the day they get their driver’s license, because having your license means you have the freedom to go anywhere and do anything. As a sixteen year old, you don’t always have many things you get to control in your life, but being able to drive is a very freeing experience. 
<br><br>
 I think the solution to reducing car usage is actually tied in with what Ken mentioned weeks earlier in one of his discussions or lectures. If we promoted more public transportation and bicycle lanes, then this would encourage more people to switch over to using public transportation or even bicycling instead of using a car. Cars have been tied into America since they were invented. There’s no doubt that people and cars have very deep ties that go back decades. However, if we are to act on climate change, we need to look beyond just improving the car. We need to be reducing the amount of cars on the road, whether that includes reducing the manufacturing of cars, encouraging public transportation, or both. There's really no reason for one person to own a fleet of new vehicles. The amount of money that people pour into their cars is not only unreasonable, but they are promoting the destruction of our planet and even risk killing themselves everyday they get on the road.

 This video surprised me, as I, probably like many others thought that electric cars were going to help combat the climate crisis. I have an attachment to my car, as I use it to drive to my job and around town to run errands etc. There is something inherently convenient about owning and driving a car. When I first reflected on the thought, “Could I give up using my car?” My immediate first reaction was “heck no”. I think that in order to catalyze a true climate movement, we must forsake the idea of convenience. I am, like many others, selfish. But in order for this crisis to be mitigated, we must forsake an ‘I’ society to a ‘we’ society. But this act seems impossible, especially on such a large scale and in  a short timeframe. I can’t help but wonder, will we ever be able to mitigate this crisis? Hahaha is it just me or does this class get more and more depressing with each lecture?

I agree with your comment completely.  It is pretty hard to be optimistic in the way that we can resolve the climate crisis.  I think that many people are unwilling to give up certain aspects of their lives like owning a car.  It is surprising to know that electric cars are not as many people thought in being safe for our environment.   While electric cars emit less co2 there is still a great amount of greenhouse gases being emitted during the car production.  This is a shocking fact because many people are unaware of being part of the problem. When Ken mentions that the carbon footprint of cars exceeds that of houses I was shocked.  That fact alone shows how we must change certain aspects of how we live in order to effectively help resolve the climate crisis.

 In a perfect world, I think it would be ideal for everyone to follow the advice given in this video regarding transportation. If cities invested more in transportation, and citizens had more money that wasn't going into a car, rather the economy possibly, I think many of our cities and most certainly our environment would be better off. However, there are quite a few things that weren't addressed in the video. The point was frequently made that cars are sold as "cool," but I don't think that's really the case. While that might be some marketing tactic, the appeal to cars has to most notably be their convenience; this is the "freedom" of a car. Unless public transportation was made to be lightning quick, a car is always going to be more convenient. In elementary school, I used to have to take the public bus to school because I lived out of district and my family only had one car. Taking the public bus took me nearly an hour to get to school, which could easily be made into a 10 to 15 minute drive in a car. This time difference is too significant to convince people to transition to. As well, at this point in our history, it would take A LOT to simply rewrite our car culture that has been intertwined with US history. I think we'd see a similar response from a lot of the population as we see now with the gun control debate, but that's a whole different beast.
<br><Br>
Inevitably, I think it is necessary that we are going to need to take a more technological approach to fixing the climate crisis. Putting resources into making a completely zero emission car or investing in the proposed bullet train or simply researching how we can maximize the efficiency of our transportation. At any cost, it is not realistic to expect our society to be willing to move backwards in technological advancement, so we must look forward to new technological solutions.

I also think the most prominent aspect of cars is their convenience, but the car culture in America is undeniably huge. Cars are considered cool because of the freedom they give a driver, because they are another piece of property people can own, and they’re a part of the American Dream image. I strongly agree that cities need to invest more in transportation, especially because I am from LA and the metro system is terrible. Here in SB I bike to all my classes, I take the bus around Goleta and downtown, and I take the train when I go home. But in LA, there is no way to get around without a car. It is impossible to get rid of car culture here without creating an accessible and efficient mass transit system. 
<br><br>
I want to be optimistic about the climate crisis, but people suck and they refuse to change. I also think we must take a technological approach, but I also think that we cannot solely rely on technology to save us. People imagine a world without cars and think we’re going to ride carriages around everywhere, but mass transportation is the solution. And the point about how much money Americans will save is a great incentive, Americans do love money.

 In the snippet, it questions whether buying an electric car  should be an option. Ken emphasizes how there are different options of avoiding purchasing cars like using buses or trains to get to their destination, public transportation. This will allow us to use less gas and less CO2 to the atmosphere. He also emphasizes how there are more cars than driver licenses. This also emphasizes and distinguishes how this is a safety hazard and why we engage in these practices. We love cars and the culture of cars. Because of the attraction we have on cars, this will cause more climate crises and develop more climate catastrophes. The burden to keep the car is averagely  9 thousand dollars and keeping up to its proper conditions. Cars can cause a lot of problems and more problems can continue to arise due to the production of cars and the effect on it. There are more ideas and ways to navigate to get to their destination, but it is going to be very hard to get rid of cars since cars are so popular and wanted. The first thing you want to do usually when you are eighteen is get your license or get a car to go to places. Cars is a very common materialistic thing to have and to some people it is a necessity to have to go to their job if certain transportation services don’t go to those areas.

 I was surprised about the fact that hybrid car actually produce carbon dioxide through the process of production. I thought car brands like Tesla is the cure to the current overloaded car problem on earth. But it's obvious that I am wrong. Hybrid car is an alternative but it won't solve the problem thoroughly. The statistics that Chinese cars increase by 10,000% in 3 decades is scary. When it comes to actual numbers, I understand the extent human are harming the environment.
<br><br>
Ken pointed out that why people still buy and use cars when they actually know they are not being environmental-friendly is because of sociological reasons. People always connect cars with cool and fashion. However, using public transportation and being free of automobile is also cool, that's what Ken is talking about. Protecting the environment should always be the coolest thing that human can contribute to the protection of the environment. 
<br><br>
I agree with Ken that the car problem can't be solved simply by STEM scientists. Consciousness should be raised in every individual's mind. Social scientists should promote that protecting the planet simply by taking bus, subway, train, bicycle will be huge contribution if everyone is doing the same.
<br><br>
After watching the video, I am taking the suggestion seriously. Before I always talk about being green in daily life by taking public transportation. But when comes to actual situations, I still take cars a lot. This video addresses the impact of personal decisions on a large social scale. Considering the cost of buying and taking care of a car, we can actually give up the car at all and put that large amount of money in our retire account. Retire in the early 40s is more a freedom compares to owning a car. We can actually make wise use of our money while being environmental-friendly simultaneously.

 As an international student, I never understood the American suburban lifestyle. People wanting to live further apart from each other so that they can buy more cars and drive faster and consume more gasoline? It just didn't and still doesn't make any sense to me. This short lecture really helped solidify my belief that cars and highways are an utterly wasteful use of resources. 
<br><br>

It's fascinating to me that the average American work one day a weeks to afford a car and that without one, they can have three day weekends and even retire 10 years + early. I wonder whether the average person is aware of this, and whether that will make them change their minds about cars, because to me, that sounds like so much more freedom that simply being able to drive anywhere anytime you want. Especially when we can already do that to an extent with buses and trains.
<br><br>

It was definitely interesting to hear about the history of how the culture surrounding cars came to be, about how the US economy is dependent upon transportation, which I think will present a challenge as we try to move away from cars, as there is so much government funding into the automobile industry, in order to keep industry and the economy going, making public transportation less convenient and less accessible in some places. 
<br><br>

But I think it is still possible to reengineer the culture that we live in. The economy is all about supply and demand. The government can't force cars down our throats if we realize the full consequence of cars and decide that we do not want them. We can vote for government officials who care. The automobile industry will wither, but, hopefully, with all the money we save from cars, we can invest it in other meaningful aspects of our lives, which will open up new sectors in the economy, hopefully ones that doesn't cost us our planet.

 I would not consider myself to be an actual environmentalist because I still drive. I liked how Professor Ken related how much carbon we can release that’ll help the planet to the FDA recommendations for eating. I was surprised to hear that the car production was more of the issue for pollution rather than it actually driving. Now knowing that less producing less than 2 metric tons of CO2 is what actually helps the planet, I was shocked to hear that just owning a car pushes me past that initial limit. 

<br><br>

It is a harsh reality to know that driving will always be something that is damaging the planet. I had to rewind the video when Ken said that it is actually possible to go to LA to NY with just 4 gallons of gas. I was expected some crazy technological advancement but laughed when he said it is possible with buses and trains. I liked how he promoted biking and I love how UCSB has such a strong biking culture. Before going to UCSB I never biked but now after I graduate I will most likely continue to incorporate biking into my daily life.

<br><br>

I did not realize that driving was also a cultural thing. Looking at this from an economic lens, it would actually be so beneficial for people’s bank accounts to not drive. I hope after I graduate I could potentially live in a neighborhood where I will not need a car.

 I really enjoyed this lecture. I found the statistics especially interesting. For example, I had no idea that we have more cars than licensed drivers in the U.S. It was shocking to hear that a Toyota Prius, which is a car that I see as very environmentally friendly, releases 17 metric tons of Co2 during production. I was also surprised to hear that a car that sits in your driveway would use up your allotment of Co2 (2 metric tons) just because of its initial emission and the fact that it only lasts 11 years. This is not including any other expenditures like your food, clothes, and housing so, if we were to stay in the 2 degree celsius range, all you would have is an expensive, deadly car unused in your driveway. This leads me to my next point. I had no idea how inefficient cars were. Like I’ve mentioned before, I drive a Tesla and always considered the car to be environmentally friendly. Even though Ken did mention that electric cars generate half of the emissions of gasoline cars, manufacturing electric cars still produces somewhere between 15 and 68 percent more greenhouse gases than gasoline cars. Because of this, electric cars are still a problem. It is clear that the best way to reduce emissions is to forget about cars and to use public transit. 
<br><br>
In order to get back home from UCSB, I like to take the train. While 5 hours is a long commute to get to Orange County, the train offers comfort that cars simply cannot provide. Finding out that a train is 30 times more efficient than a car gives me an even greater incentive to take the train. Still, I think that it is going to take a lot of changes in our cities for there to be a change in our society. The culture that we have today is one that makes it crucial for people to own a car. I know that for me in high school, it was almost a given that students would get a car for their 16th birthday and if they didn't, surely they would get one for their 17th. For many people, it affected their social status and could even be a way to make friends. For buses and trains to seem cooler than cars, people will need to feel like there is an incentive to use them. It’s funny because you would think that being able to retire in your late 40’s would be incentive enough, but I think that even if people knew this fact, they would still opt for the car. I think current transportation systems need to be cared for better and become more advanced so that they are appealing enough for the average consumer to switch from a car to public transportation. I hope that, in the future, more cities follow Portland and Brooklyn’s example and develop an eco culture.

I drive a Prius and I prided myself that I thought I was being environmentally conscious, so to hear the facts that Ken is sharing about this was fairly disappointing. It was an interesting point that our society has gotten distracted about the correct progress of cars, instead of focusing on more miles for 1 gallon we really do need to focus on reengineering our use of cars. Like you mentioned, I think getting a "first car" is seen as such a social norm, that in order to reduce the cars on the road this is a trend that would need to disappear. Because of this being a way to showcase social status, it was less common to want to use public transportation because they aren't as "cool". When my younger sister was in high school and students started getting cars, other students started taking Ubers and Lyfts around instead of walking or using public transportation. This just continues the issue of our increasing carbon footprint. I also think that we as humans are burying ourselves deeper into the world of technology and by default becoming more antisocial. Because of that I think that cars give us our space to be alone and in control of our environment, rather than having to share a space with people we don know. I don't use my car that often but its upsetting to know damage is still being done right from my driveway. Like you said, our public transportation systems need to be more advanced. It would be a critical study to find out why people aren't taking advantage of these types of transportations and then put the time and money in to change them. How are we going to make public transportation more attractive to the people?

I had a similar experience in high school. Everyone I knew had a car or was planning on getting one. If you didn’t have enough knowledge on cars, you weren’t interesting or cool, deemed by other students who held “status” or popularity. Car culture is very large in South San Diego. People host extravagant car shows to show off their “toys.” People bring hundreds of cars to flaunt for style and status. In a similar sense, the cooler toys you have as kid, the more cool you are in general. I think many people, myself excluded, feel the same about cars.
<br><br>
It’s a shame that public transportation isn’t more celebrated. After all, trains are an awesome alternative for road trips. I travel often between UCSB and San Diego. I love the train because it’s very scenic and I know that I’m using efficient transportation. 
<br><br>
It will take a long time to undo all the cultural norms people are accustomed to. It is difficult to think about the transition given the level of dependency many people have in regards to cars. I trust that people will transition to use public transportation more often because of environmental efforts, but it’s up to the rest of America to make the effort too. Given how strong car culture is in many regions, I think a solution would be making the sprawling suburbs more accessible by implementing more public transport.

 I too enjoyed this lecture and found the statistics very insightful. I was watching this video while studying with friends and I just had to pause the lecture and tell them about what I was hearing. I too had no idea that we have more cars than licensed drivers in the U.S. Although, as I shared this with my friends, we all realized just how many people use cars today and how common it is to own multiple cars. Back home, I went to a high school in a predominantly white, blue collar town and owning a car was commonality. But not just a car, my parking lot was full of a variety of higher end makes and model: Jeeps, Mercedes, a handful of Range Rovers, and even a couple sports cars. My used 2017 Toyota Corolla Sport barely held its own in the first row of ASB spots and that's saying something. 

One of my friends I am studying with, currently attends UCLA, and when she first arrived at UCSB on her visit this weekend, the first thing she commented on was all of the bikes on campus. Now, in my second quarter here, this is normal to me. So normal, I almost forgot what it is like to drive my car back home. The culture here at UCSB is especially unique in this way and it has definitely opened my eyes to living a more eco-friendly lifestyle. Therefore, I think this made hearing all of the statistics in the video more shocking. I was especially surprised to learn that a car that sits in your driveway can use up your entire allotment of suggested CO2 (2 metric tons) just because of its initial emission. This fact alone, in my opinion, should be enough to convince people to drive a more fuel efficient car or to utilize our current public transportation systems. As Ken mentions, 1 gallon of gasoline can transport a person by bus 350 miles. The subway is 20 times more efficient: 500 miles per gallon.  And the train 30 times more: 750 miles per gallon. I too take the train home to Orange County and after watching this video I feel as if I am making a difference, no matter how small it may actually be.

 One thing that cars give people that mass transit options like buses and trains can't is a sense of personal space. Sure, cars are similar to buses and trains because they get you from one place to another and you can sit while riding in them, but driving your own car is a luxury that mass transit doesn't offer. Consumers can pick which brand of car they want to buy, which model of that brand and maybe even personalize the features of it. This freedom is a big factor in why so many people buy cars. Simply put, when someone rides a train or bus they can't be choosy about how the train looks or which services it offers. People buy cars because riding mass transit is an option that may be less convenient and likely less comfortable for people than driving their own car. I think in order for carbon emissions caused by car usage to make an impactful decline would be enforcing that cars must be ridden in/owned by three or more people and that public transit must become more personally accommodating for passengers. Just telling people to use mass transit instead of their own car that they spent so much money on will fail.
<br><br>

Establishing the infrastructure for mass transit is an initiative that needs to be implemented very soon in the United States in order to land a punch on carbon dioxide emissions. Like the abundance of highways, freeways, and roads that people use in their cars, a massively interconnected network should be instilled for methods of travel for trains. Mass transit is successful in the areas where it is because it is convenient, wide-spreading and cheap. To make mass transit the main form of transportation in the United States, these three elements are required, in addition to what I mentioned earlier about making mass transit more personally accommodating. I really think moving towards regularly using mass transit and away from using personal vehicles will make the biggest impact regarding carbon emissions associated with traveling.

I wholly agree that freedom is one of the biggest factors that continue to attract consumers to cars. Privacy, comfort, and freedom are always of priority in American culture and it most definitely reflects in the automotive industry. I also believe that mass transit through high speed rail is the best future in regards to both environmental and economic terms. I really enjoyed a video discussing high speed rail that I highly recommend watching/will attach and discuss below. 

<br><br>

Now, in regards to the lecture video, I found it particularly interesting because less than a week ago I watched a short documentary video by CNBC, titled “Why The US Has No High-Speed Rail”, which discussed why America has fallen so far behind other nations in expanding and implementing rail systems to be used for more efficient [environmentally] and inexpensive means of travel. According to the video, Japanese and Chinese rail systems [high speed] have become a staple for domestic travel and have moved more than 9 billion people without a single passenger casualty. But, both Ken and CNBC allude to the post World War II era of transition away from popular rail [which the U.S. dominated prior] towards an obsession and take over of automobile transportation. I agree in the lecture’s title that climate crisis is a culture problem because our entire society is a car culture, one of the highest contributors of greenhouse and C02 emissions that our countries accounts for. Even though it may seem that we can never be taken out of the cycle of automobile culture, surveys have shown that more and more people (especially young people) would prefer to switch towards a system of high speed rail if it was offered means of transport. 

<br><br>

I truly enjoyed travelling mainly by rail in Europe for a month and a half, and I think it would be a very promising route our nation could take to combat our current transportation culture along with the environmental crises it continues to fuel. If we were to convince our nation to recognize and support the need for a massive infrastructure shift towards high speed and mass transport rail, I think it would be the best option that would keep both our environmental and economic priorities in check. Rail is the most efficient, inexpensive, and eco-friendly option that we have. Many other countries have implemented train transportation into daily life and have continued to thrive off of its systems. Although the hardest part will be breaking away from car culture in the U.S., it could be the most impactful for our environment.

 I think that it is pretty crazy that in three decades, the amount of car owners increased by 10,000%. It is so clear that cars are one of the main issues in the climate crisis because we are at a point where much of the world views them as a necessity despite their high emissions and the other emissions from manufacturing. I had never really considered that electric cars emit more greenhouse gases in the production process than regular cars; this information should definitely be made more clear to the public who believes that they are being very sustainable in buying an electric car. 
<br><Br>
I like that Ken addresses the common thought that technology will solve the climate crisis. A few years ago, I remember thinking that with how much technologic advances were being made, we would obviously eventually find a way to create something that could combat climate change, but I have learned that this is unrealistic. Technology is a major problem contributing to the climate crisis and is not going to be our sole savior. 
<br><br>
The fact that cars being "cool" is a main factor in why people spend vast amounts of money on them, when public transportation is much cheaper and much more sustainable is very strange to consider. As Ken was talking about this, I was thinking about how freeing having a car is and how in college I miss having a car because it made life easier. This is a lazy way of going about life, but it is the way that many people feel. One of the facts that made me rethink this is that someone would typically work an extra full day each week to afford a car, and without a car you could work less each week and retire earlier. This made me think back to the “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy” video because working less also decreases consumption, killing two birds with one stone.

I felt the same way you did about the technological advances that were being made. I thought for sure they would figure out a way to solve the climate crisis, but every year I have less and less hope. Figuring out technical readjustments that can be made is a good step in the right direction, but as Ken and you mention, the sociological aspect to the climate crisis is playing a major role and will be harder to change. This video actually made me feel less hopeful for the future of the climate crisis. We can make technological changes, but it is going to be really difficult to get people to change their way of life, when they don't immediately see the benefits. The sad part is that I feel like people will always see cars as "cool", and in fact the amount of people who do is rising. We are moving in the wrong direction and I don't see any sign of changing. It is going to be interesting to see what it takes to change people's minds, because It is very difficult to get people to step out of their routine that they are comfortable in, for the greater good of the environment. I have a few questions as well that I was wondering while watching the video. If I don't own a car, how do I realistically get to and from work everyday that is roughly thirty to forty-five minutes away? It would easily take an hour or two on a bus, and would completely alter the course of everyday. It makes sense to not own a car in New York, where most things are within walking distance or subway, but in LA everything is a twenty minute drive away. And what if I want to take someone on a date? Do we take the bus to dinner? That's gross and not attractive to the person I'm going on a date with. If I don't own a car, they would be comparing me to someone who does own a car. Even if we uber, it is still taking a car to get there. I just feel like the dependency on cars is irreversible at this point, and I am left with little hope for the recovery from this climate crisis.

 As a Chinese, even we have witnessed the rapid development of China in recent 3 decades, still cannot believe that the amount of cars owned by Chinese people has increased to 10000% times than before. Cars, for sure, benefit our lives by bring us convenience. Yet it accounts for over a quarter of annual carbon dioxide emission for human beings. It makes sense that people need car in cities, especially in mega cities. Cars save a lot of time for us. Yet, currently, the amount of cars outnumbers the amount of driver license holders. Here, I wanna ask, do we really need that many cars? It is reported that in the next 15 years, the amount of cars will double in the United States. That’s an astonishing number, and of course carbon emission will continue to grow. We can reduce the usage of car by taking public transportations. Before, I don’t like to take public transportation as well; I like the convenience cars bring to me and I am not willing to walk for minutes. Yet, as the public transportation system in China developed rapidly, I can actually get to my destiny faster than driving cars. Therefore, if the United States can invest more on constructing public transportation, things will get better soon. If people are more willing to take more buses and metro, it’s a large step to reduce global warming.

I found your input about car use and transportation in another country is very interesting. I think that we do not need that many cars but here in the US, it is part of the culture to own a car. I agree many cities in the US need to invest in public transportation so it becomes more convenient to use than a car. Not only that, but they need to get rid of that mindset that these environmentally disastrous cars are “cool”. That will be so much harder because it is all over American culture, celebrities that people look up to are always flaunting the number of cars they have. Someone who comes to mind is Cardi B, she has been on talk shows and said she doesn't know how to drive but has an impressive car collection, “to take pictures with.” Even though she may never drive them, as Prof. Hiltner stated, “If you leave them in your driveway parked and never drive them… expended your CO2 allotment for your lifetime.” These cars are expensive and bad for the environment with all the CO2 it emits; yet, many people are willing to work a whole day of their week just to be able to afford the car they drive. A good idea would be to introduce a cheaper and more convenient form of transportation here in the US to encourage people to move away from using cars.

 One of the most interesting aspects for me of this lecture was the brief history of the car. It fascinates me that the car came into the picture just as we Americans were working towards suburbia. This meant moving towards bigger houses and greater distance between places. These factors pushed people to want to live in the dream that was Suburbia. Previous to this, people lived in relatively small or medium sized houses, often close together, with stores and other places of necessity near by. This was most likely a time of far less CO2 emissions. It simply goes to show that the moment we exceeded the basic amount of things that we NEED, we begin to consume more things we WANT. In this case, people wanted bigger houses, wider streets, cars, and more. It was the "American Dream." However, this is when consumerism reaches its prime. It is also when fossil fuel companies started booming. There is a direct correlation between increased consumption, and increased emissions. People wanted to be happy, or at least seem it, especially coming out of the Great Depression. More "stuff" = more "happiness." 
<br><br>

For fossil fuel companies, this need to constantly consume is a gold mine. We still see this today. People want even bigger houses; even nicer cars. A display of wealth is a display of happiness. However, many people cannot afford these aspects of a luxurious lifestyle, yet still buy into it. They take out a loan for their car, when taking public transport is far far cheaper. Why? Because they want to seem equal to everyone else. American's seem to be in a constant competition with one another, and it needs end. We need to start focusing on ourselves as individuals. Do I really need a car? Do I really this large house? We need to question our underlying reasons for wanting these things. From there, we can move onto actions that not only have a positive impact on the environment, but on ourselves. Taking public transit is not only better for the environment, but better for your wallet. The money you save from not buying a car can be put towards things you actually need. 
<br><br>

However, I do understand the difficulty moving away from life with your own car. After having a car back homer two years, moving here and not having one was a difficult transition. Yet, I adjusted just fine. I can easily bike to class, and when it's raining, Have easy access to public transit. When taking the bus to get groceries and what not, I can do my homework on the drive! (Something I would not be able to do while driving my own car). Take minute and think, what do you own that actually need vs what do you own that is only fulfilling your wants...

From the 1960's to now, there have also been a lot of technological improvements in our world. I believe that regressing back into this time would just also revert our advancements in this world. We may as well go back into hunting and gathering at this point because there's no carbon emissions at all anymore right? So many problems have been introduced because of these moving times, but what happened already happened. Our world is already damaged, so instead of trying to revert back into another time,  how about we as a whole find solutions into this problem? 
<br><br>
Coming from home to college here, it was also easy to adjust to having no car, however you fail to understand how small IV is compared to every where else in the world. From where I am from, LA is 503 square miles. Compare that to IV (1.88 square miles) of course it would be easier to adjust to life here. Everything is smaller here. But compare how you live at home to how you live here. Are you happier here than at home? Coming from this huge city, biking EVERWHERE is also not a possibility. Personally, I know people who live in Irvine that work in Alhambra. Driving would take 43 minutes with no traffic, bussing would take 2 hours and 37 minutes, and biking would take 4 HOURS and 23 MINUTES. This simply just isn't a possibility for this person to have a healthy social, work, and sleep life.

 The human condition is laziness; read my entire comment to find out why. A quarter of our individual carbon footprints can be attributed to our cars. The problem with cars involves their productions. Producing electric cars is more costly and it only reduces our emissions by half. I couldn't believe it when he said we expand our CO2 allotment for our lifetime just by buying cars. Sorry to put you on the spot and play the devil’s advocate here but, do you (Ken Hiltner) drive a car? Have you flown in a plane? These innovations have undoubtedly brought us very far and have become a way in which our society operates. High speed rails are not a widespread reality. Life is so fast paced even here in California where we are considered a more environmentally friendly state. Society would have to slow down if we were to switch to public transportation. For example, last year when I would visit home I would take Amtrak which but me on a bus for 2 hours that connected to a train for two hours. It would take me 6 hours to get home when the car ride would take 3 to 3 ½ hours. It doubled the time it would have taken me to get home. Do you think that Americans will willingly sacrifice their transportation efficiency? This year I carpool with friends to get back home. Do you think that is a more feasible way to reduce emissions? I don't own a car. With apps like Uber do you think that we could reduce car ownership through access to transportation via others cars?You said that we need to figure out why people think cars are so cool and buses not. I believe I have an answer. Cars offer convenience. If you travel by bus you have to work around the bus’s schedule and you likely have to walk or bike to the bus stop or station. Cars give you the ability to walk right outside your door, hop in, and then freedom of transport is at your fingertips. The long story short for this problem is that people are lazy. They don’t want to wake up earlier, expel extra energy, and plan their day around public transportation. They rather spend $40 in gas to drive somewhere themselves than to pay for a $40 train ticket to get somewhere. The human condition is laziness.

 After watching this video I am surprised to say the least, surprised that cars are more damaging than I originally thought and surprised that Americans were brainwashed into thinking that cars are an essential to our daily lives. I am torn between this because as much as I hate the dependency we have on cars to get around because of the ease and freedom they offer, I was raised to depend on them and to make it a personal goal to purchase a nice car. I think we can all agree, to a certain extent, that it is easier to change our diets than to change our reliance on cars. The American people have been encouraged and dedicated to owning a car and using it on a daily basis, and this is going to be difficult to turn around. However, with the presented statistics I believe it can be successful to a certain extent. 
<br><br>
One point I found interesting is that the US has less than 4% of the world's population, yet it holds 1/4 of the cars on the planet. This is why Ken explains that we should turn our attention towards car use rather than car manufacturing. As Ken suggests numerous time in this video, we should focus on rewriting/re-engineering the cultural practice of car use because technology alone will not solve the climate crisis. We must learn to embrace public transit and normalize taking public transit to run our daily errands. We should encourage not relying on cars to get to places and we should encourage not needing a car to feel successful, which is going to be difficult to achieve. We must take a step back and realize that the manufacturing of cars is going to continue to be supported and encouraged by big corporations, so we have to focus on what WE as consumers can do to stray away from this. We need to turnaround the damage that was done post-Great Depression during the industrialized war. It is not going to be an easy task but we can start by challenging ourselves  to get our errands done by taking public transit, and proving that it is not as bad as some may think, then encouraging those around us to do the same. As Ken explains, we must approach this as a human issue and not just an environmental one.

 Growing up along the coast of Southern California, many of my high school memories included driving along Pacific Coast Highway, windows down, listening to music with a group of friends. While I can personally say that driving has often offered me a sense of freedom, fun, and a ticket to getting around whenever I need, I can also say that there were not many other options of getting around the suburb that I lived in. If buses or biking had been more socially “cool” in my society growing up, I think I could have had just as many amazing memories with friends, just without being in a car. It is also ridiculous to me that so many families I know have more than one car. They have more than one car so that one of the parents can get to work and the other can drive their kids to school and then take them to after school commitments. They have more than one car only for their children to grow up and get their own new car. Families with multiple children gradually add car after car to their lives, costing thousands and thousands of dollars, only for their car to grow old and purchase yet another one. People see so much individual value and respect in the amount of cars they have and how nice they are. If instead of feeling proud by the cars we collect and own and whip around, we could feel proud in taking the bus, subway, etc., then our environment would be drastically different and the amount of tragedies caused by vehicles each year would decrease significantly. I think the U.S. needs to work on implementing more time on luxurious public transportation, rather than luxurious individual cars. If people feel just as excited to hop on the bus versus to hop in their car, then big changes could be made.

Much like you said, many of my favorite memories at home involve riding in my car with my friends. I have an attachment to my car and it was difficult for me to hear that it’s one of the largest parts of my carbon footprint. However, some of the findings that Ken mentioned were really convincing in terms of the benefits of letting go of my attachment. The fact that the money you earn from a whole day of work per week goes into the payment for your car and its maintenance is crazy to think about. What really resonated with me was when Ken said that if we subtracted the total amount of money we spend on cars in our lives we could retire in our early 40s. I think hearing that really put things into perspective about how much money really goes into having a car and how big the benefits (besides the obvious environmental benefits) of not having a car could be. 


<br><br>
However, similar to your situation, the biggest problem I have is that my suburb does not have many other options of getting around. Even to get to the bus stop you would need a car! I think that if more money went into creating convenient public transportation systems for people in the suburbs (similar to how the ones in bigger cities), more people would be inclined to use these modes of transportation rather than sit in traffic and commute to work. As most car owners live in the suburbs, I think that this is a major factor in converting them into users of public transportation.

 I honestly can say that I don't agree with the message of this video. I don't think cars will ever be phased out of the global economy, nor do I think they should. Technology will continue to develop and continue to reduce the average C02 expenditure per vehicle -- it is also unrealistic for most people to adopt the perspective of relying on public transport all the time. In the US, a large majority of people will have to commute more than thirty minutes to and from work. For one, relying on public transport is sometimes time-inefficient and grueling. Cars allow us to have the autonomy to do as we want/need. If I want to road trip across the country or visit family nearby then I don't have to conform my schedule around that of public transport. 
<br><br>

Without a doubt, there needs to be change within the industry, but I don't think phasing out cars is in anyway plausible nor realistic. It is somewhat an integral part of our culture in this day in age. If the global economy is moving towards electric vehicles and looking to reduce our carbon footprint, then the economy/producers will shift towards that goal. 
<br><br>

Yes, it is great to use public transport when possible, but it is not necessarily the easiest alternative to reducing your carbon footprint. Changing your diet towards a plant-based one is much easier than just selling your car and attempting to rely on public transport for the rest of your life. If there is an industry that needs to further advance its technology to reduce their carbon footprint, it is the aviation industry. Planes need to start becoming EVs if we want a realistic solution to widespread public transport.

There's no doubt that this will be difficult. It's a had question to answer: how do we change an entire culture--while simultaneously maintaining our rights and freedoms? Not all people will want to trade their convenient options for something a little less convenient, even if it is better for the planet.
<br><Br>
However, we need a solution that sustains, and the fact of the matter is that cars simply cannot do that. While the aviation industry needs reformation as well, you can't just shift the focus of the problem to a different area; we will need to find a solution for ALL parts of the issue, including both automobiles and aviation. 
<br><Br>
It doesn't matter if it's not the easiest alternative. If we continue using cars in the way that we do, in the mass quantity that we do, the planet will keep warming.
<br><Br>
It takes a mass cultural shift. Starting this will be where most of the difficulty lies, but once we start moving in a direction that supports a lifestyle that doesn't revolve around cars, it will start getting easier. We need to redirect our money and resources towards a more efficient transportation system, and in doing so it will become so much easier to promote a lifestyle change. I'm not sure if you've ever been to a country with an efficient transportation system, but I can say, as someone who has, that it's both achievable and even more convenient to use than cars oftentimes.
<br><Br>
We can't rely on technology getting better and solving our issue, this is something that needs to take place culturally as well. It's not going to be easy, but a shift is necessary.

 I am very surprised to hear that even the potentially the best way to solve, or slow down the problem of global warming, which is to have an electronic car, can still contributes large portion of green house gases to the atmosphere. In the lecture, professor says that even many people, even industries, now believe that the use of electronic car can cut down the carbon emission to zero, there are still lots of carbon emitted during the production process of the car. 

<br><br>
However, I do not understand why the professor is very pessimistic towards this issue. I do admit that those change can have relatively small benefit to our climate, but that doesn’t mean that those portions of benefit can be ignored by us. I believe that under current circumstance, it is impossible for a person not to buy a car, not even in some big cities where public transportation is very advanced. Thus, I think even though the carbon emission of electronic cars is still high and cannot meet the ideal requirement, but it is still the plausible way to alter our current condition. With the development of technology, many people now can purchase those type of cars and contribute to the reduction of carbon emission. Every little bit of our actions helps.

I was also shocked when I learned that even electronic car would contribute to a larger number of carbon footprint. Even though Ken reiterates that manufacturing a car will produce lots of greenhouse gas, it’s impossible to prevent the production and usage of car all over the world. Overall, car is much more efficient and convenient than bus or bike especially during emergency and terrible weathering condition. As far as I’m concerned, it’s suitable for each family to own as few cars as possible. Cars not only produce much pollution, but also takes space and the government has to build more parking lot to accommodate this situation. We must take other actions to meet the goal in reduction of carbon dioxide gas suggested by the Paris Agreement and I really hope Ken can give us some feasible suggestions regarding environmentally-friendly lifestyle. Its quite difficult for a culture change to take place and even it happens, there’s a time delay which may reinforce the climate crisis at present. I recommend us to take both culture changes and research on technical solutions.

 The aspect of Ken’s video lecture this week about how cars give off massive amounts of CO2 was quite startling to me. I never thought about how much our cars really impact the environment. I remember in elementary school when we would have “walk and roll to school day” on earth day once a year. I lived one block away from my elementary school growing up, and my mother was a teacher at the same school. I am ashamed to say that we drove to school every day, which was less than a two minute drive. It would have been really easy for us to walk every day, but we never did because my mom had all of her school bags with her, and it was just “too much work”. If we walked to and from school everyday, not only would we be beginning to practice healthy habits, but we would be reducing our carbon footprint on the way. Similarly, I never think twice about driving to visit my friends in San Diego from UCSB. However, if I were to take the train, Ken says I could be 30 times more carbon efficient. Little things like walking to school or taking a train rather than a car are great steps in the direction of reducing my overall carbon footprint. As with many of the suggestions in this class, these things may seem small, but altogether lead to a greater impact on our climate.

I agree that it is crazy how much of a Carbon footprint a car alone produces. The fact that by just having a car and never driving it alone releases more carbon than should be allotted per person is mind boggling. Not breathing, eating, or anything else, just by having a car in the driveway. Like you said, having a hybrid doesn’t do as much to help the environment as most of us originally thought which is also crazy. I have never owned a car and was that kid who had to carpool, walk or bike everywhere and I had always longed for my own set of wheels. After hearing what Ken had to say, I no longer am ashamed of biking 3 miles to and from work. Imagine if everyone biked. Imagine how much CO2 we would save from being released into the atmosphere. Think of how many less people would die. Think of how much better the health of everyday  people would be. If we as a society could get over the stigma of not being able to drive because it isn’t cool, our society’s future would be in so much better shape than it currently is. I will continue to say it, we as college kids can only do so much to help reform our world, but it starts with us, but must end with the older generations following our lead. I will try to do my part as you are doing, and I can't wait to learn about more we can do to save our planet.

 It is funny how this idea that seemed cool for generations has suddenly became the consequence of a devastating event, climate change. Driving has always been a dream for teenagers, for example such as myself; as soon as I turned 18 (since I’m not American), I wanted to drive really bad. I wanted to show all my friends who do not have a driving license how cool I am and how capable I am. But now, this idea that was “cool” has been criticized by many scholars and activists such as Professor Hiltner, and I totally understand that. When driving to Los Angles or driving in China, the traffic congestion not only frustrates me but also gets me thinking about the mass amount of exhaust emission’s effect on the air around me. I am, technically breathing in the fumes that all of the cars around me are emitting. 
<br><br>
Returning to the initial topic that Professor Hiltner was arguing for, I was completely shocked by how electric cars actual do not contribute to this modern idea of saving global warming. When given the statistics of how much gasoline and emissions that electronic cars could save, it all sounded surreal. But when the professor offered me the actual emission of the production of an electric car, reality hits hard. I currently do not own a car, but what is forcing me to buy a car is the inconvenient public transportation system in California. Coming from China, everything was by bus and train because they are fast, convenient as well as economic; but in California, going from Santa Barbara to Los Angles in a three hour train is totally unbearable for a person who is used to fast public transport. 
<br><Br>
I have watched an episode of Patriot Act in which Hasan Minjah criticized the Koch Brother for not allowing for a better be public transport system because they are befitting from the car industry. It is ultimately due to these huge corporations that we deem driving as “cool” and public transport as “not cool”. It is also the reason public transport around the region is limited and not improved. 
<br><br>
It certainly makes me sad that public transportation is not being emphasized by the US government, because if this issue is not resolved, car culture would continue for as long as cars are being produced.

It amazes me how in several decades, US car manufacturers and the government were able to convince the entire nation and the rest of the world that cars are “cool”. I also remember when my friends and I first received our licenses. At the time, we were so excited to finally have this newfound sense of freedom. I never would have thought that a train ticket could give me even more freedom. However, this lecture convinced me that cars are really not freeing at all. I was amazed to learn that cars are not economical and that the average cost of owning a car is about $9,000 each year. Therefore, the average American works one day out of the five day work week just to own a car. Furthermore, I never knew that a person’s car emits 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, amounting to about one-fourth of the average American's carbon footprint. 
<br><br>


This lecture left me somewhat pessimistic about the future. One of the solutions Ken offered was to rewrite our cultural practices, such as our love of cars. However, this will not be an easy task. Cars are incredibly ingrained in American culture. In fact, the US has 4% of the world's population but 25% of its cars. I do not know how we will be able to change American’s views of cars. At the same time, we cannot expect other countries to take action and change their relation to cars if we do not do it ourselves. For instance, China is now the largest car market in the world and between 1985 and 2017, there was a 10,000% increase in cars.

 The common perception of electric cars is their low emissions and sustainable transportation, hardly anyone thinks about the amount of emissions behind them. Imagine what a world without cars would look like, without emissions from driving the car itself, but also from manufacturing it, paving roads, manufacturing street signs and traffic lights, building gas stations and car washes, manufacturing the tools and products needed for maintenance and washing, parking lots and garages, you get the picture. Living in a bike town like Isla Vista is refreshing coming out of suburbia. Knowing how much smaller my carbon footprint from transportation is now makes me never want to go back to a city where I have to drive everywhere. Similarly, my friends at schools in Manhattan and Chicago are enjoying taking trains, subways, and buses everywhere they go. The way that bikes and public transportation are normalized for us now makes me want to expand this mentality, like Ken said. Not only must we shift our culture to value sustainable transportation more than driving, we must make policy changes to aid this change. As much as we hate them, things like toll roads, paid parking, and high gas prices are ways of discouraging car use; and on the flip side, free bus access, more bike paths, and carpool lanes encourage alternate modes of transportation.

I agree that consumers often forget about the cost that manufacturing the things we buy has on our environment. I mean I'll admit it, I fail to take that into consideration most of the time. Although, after watching this lecture, it really brought to my attention how big of a role the manufacturing process plays in defining something's carbon footprint. When Ken explained how the production of electric cars produces 15-68% more greenhouse gases than the production of your average gasoline car, I was shocked. I’d failed to ever think that electric cars could be worse than gasoline cars during any step of a car’s lifetime. Electric cars are advertised as the solution to climate change and a sure way to cut your carbon footprint, but they’re really no solution at all. They’re simply a band-aid on a cut that needs stitches. As consumers, we neglect to take into consideration the entire lifetime of an item and what that really means for its carbon footprint. We’ve instead complacently taken things at face value as if to lessen the degree of guilt we already have. With decades of doing this, the damage we’ve done to the planet is finally catching up to us. It seems like the least we can do is reevaluate our use of cars. Since the typical U.S. car emits 4.6 metric tons of CO2 a year, which is roughly a quarter of the average American’s yearly carbon footprint, decreasing our usage of cars could have a drastic effect on slowing climate change.   

<br><br>
Similar to you, I moved to Isla Vista from a suburban town. It was hard to do something as simple as going to the grocery store without the use of a car. Once I got my license I was driving everywhere because I wanted to abuse my new found freedom. That’s how getting your license is described, gaining freedom. And maybe that’s why our society today is so obsessed with cars. We fill our driveways with thousand dollar purchases just so we can drive to work or take our kids to soccer practice. It’s ridiculous and wildly unnecessary. That’s what makes living here so refreshing. Despite almost being hit by a bike every second of the day, it makes me proud to be part of a community that has more people riding bikes than driving cars. Not only that, but it’s also opened my eyes to how practical a bike is when you live in a community built like IV. Ken mentioned that he feels science and technology alone aren’t a solution to climate change, and I agree. A change in human behaviors is necessary if we have any hope of trying to keep warming below 2 degrees celsius, which is the goal of the Paris Accord. Although, science and technology can help push human behaviors in a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly direction. If more communities are built like ours where using a bike is more convenient than driving, or getting to the nearest bus station is less costly in time than calling an uber, there’s a reasonable chance that society will begin adapting to these conveniences.

 Problem : Cars are the biggest variable of measurement in America's carbon footprint frequency distribution
<br><br>

Solution : culture change to public transportation

<br><br>


I recently traveled to Japan, seeing first hand the effectiveness of a country governed by modes of public transportation. It was such a culture shock to immerse myself in a highly populated city with such different norms affecting everyday life.  There are underground networks and above ground railroads connecting every town and city with many different lines. Since they are preparing to positively display themselves to the world in the 2020 Olympics, renovations had been made to most taxis, busses, trains, and subways. Upgrades included newly modeled cars for personal drivers, more tracks/lines for double the efficiency, and easy to understand even for tourists not able to read the language.  The cleanliness is immaculate, they were safe at any hour of the day, they compensated for the supply demand flow of human traffic even at the busiest times of the day. Rush hour, ever heard of it? .. Not in Japan ! It was "cool" and socially normal for the working class to use the Amtrak because it was faster and more efficient than driving youself. Because so many people rely on this day in and day out, hardly anyone has cars, and there's little to no street traffic . 
<br><br>



I kept telling my mom, imagine if LA had this genius, efficient method of mobilization. Every city in America shouldn’t be built by the ground up, but by the underground up. It my appear a daunting task for an Americanized viewpoint to drastically change their transportation norms. However, by having my eyes opened to different ways of function in other parts of the world, I believe America has the worst of it, not just environmentally speaking but traffic wise. Many other countries are regulated in completely different ways than us too, so it's selfish to think it's not impossible for us to change. Not just transportation wise, but Japan living standards are comfortable, luxurious apartments in high rises on top of each other. In an earlier video, our professor theorized downsizing from big houses in suburbs to city living, Japan has done that too. They are ahead of the game by solving the two biggest factors in the carbon emission distribution with great substitutions.

I found this comment very interesting. Prior to this class, I always thought the answer to climate change was technological. This personal experience, along with Ken's lectures really struck home how the best solution comes from an alteration to our culture. This comment was especially interesting to me because it showed how far ahead Japan is, and made evident the inherent stubbornness of the United States. It seems that we are either too scared to change, or don't even know how we would start. This led me to a question: How do we just change our culture? Does it start from the bottom up, or is it the other way around? I think it would be interesting to see how Japan got to the point they are know. We could probably learn and even implement some of those things into our culture. The problem I see is trying to get people to give up the homes that they've seemingly worked their whole life for.
<br><br>
On another note, I thought Ken made some good points, revealing that the solution isn't technological. In particular, I appreciated the part about EV's creating more emissions during manufacturing than traditional internal combustion vehicles. Awhile back my stepdad was looking to get a new car, and the Tesla model S was one of his top choices, partially because of the zero emissions. I had my suspicions with the whole "zero emissions" piece of EV's because the electricity has to come from somewhere. I found out that not only this but that building the battery required for these vehicles requires a lot of CO2, so much so that the car doesn't break even until years of driving. He still ended up going with the Tesla for other reasons, but something I thought was interesting is that now he claims he's doing his part to save the planet. I know that he's doing it in a joking manner, but I also know that others actually believe this, and use it to make themselves feel better about their carbon footprint. This seems like a vicious cycle of buying something that required large amounts of CO2 emissions only to justify that you're "saving the planet."
<br><hr>

These steps proposed to change the frequency distribution for anthropogenic carbon emissions are unique to America. Looking at other countries, their societies are laid out and built in regards to care for the environment. The older generation saying these 5 culture changes are inconceivable is selfish. Widening ones world view from traveling and appreciating other cultures will showcase the successful implementation of these 5 steps. We view America as the best country in the world, but I cant imagine other countries perception of America.. probably as the worst country. The declaration of independent states all people have the inalienable rights of life liberty and pursuit of happiness, but I guess that’s just for America because we are severely infringing on the rest of the worlds pursuits of these factors. Sweden is the first country to reach the EU's renewable energy targets. Germany has been called "the world's first major renewable energy economy". Of course these problems have other issues and internal factors making it impossible to directly compare and rank countries, but in terms of environment factors, America should step up.

 -       Once again in Ken’s lecture video he made very easily understandable connections and analogies between the numbers of our carbon footprint and what those numbers actually play out to be. He proceeded to tell us that an average American emits 20 metric tons of CO2 per year and that if we want to reach the goal of the Paris Accord then each person on the planet would have to only emit 2 metric tons of CO2. He then begins to describe that a car across its lifetime emits at least 2 metric tons of CO2 per year which means that, evidently, cars could not be around to reach the reduction goal. With that being said I think it is a lot easier for people to conceptualize how bad cars actually are for us. We may be getting to places faster and more conveniently but none of that will have a point in the end if we don’t have a planet. 
<br><br>
-       I also found it extremely interesting that his focus of the video was to encourage a movement for cultural change of everyday habits rather than promoting new “cleaner” technology. It is true, if we could just use less, we would all easily be making a difference in a cheaper and quicker way. Creating new, clean energy and transportation costs a lot of money and as long as there is still competition with fossil fueled transportation and energy, people will not want to pay more for something they can get for less. Although electric cars do indeed emit less than 50% of CO2 emissions than a regular, gasoline burning car, the production of them and the waste they create still has a large effect on our environment.

 Focusing on technological solutions rather than cultural solutions is like relying on medicine to cure a disease such as obesity or heart disease or even anxiety and depression. The medicine can help in a wide variety of ways! However, you can’t just take medicine. You need to make lifestyle changes such as eliminating junk from your diet and stress from your life. You also have to engage in more physical activity. Most importantly, you have to develop healthy coping mechanisms. You can’t just rely on medication, as you'll never be able to develop coping mechanisms that are more dependable than drugs. In the end, just like a medication has its side effects, so do electric cars. People will reap the long term benefits if they make lifestyle changes instead of or in addition to taking medicine, just as the world will reap the long term benefits if it makes cultural changes instead of or in addition to advancing technologies. 
<br><br>
Like Ken said in the first lecture, the climate crisis is a human problem in need of human solutions. Technological solutions are not enough.



</p><hr>


<p>
 I really liked the overall message of this lecture. The overall message of this lecture is that no matter how hard we work on our technological advances, it will never be enough to solve this climate crisis because the climate crisis is more of a cultural problem. This is a cultural problem because the solutions for this climate crisis require Americans and the rest of the world to change various things of the way they live their everyday life. As mentioned and discussed in this lecture, the usage of cars is a huge thing that must be worked on. 
<br><br>
 Ken mentions that cars account for about a quarter of an American individual’s annual carbon footprint. He suggests that in order to decrease our annual carbon footprint we must stop using cars and use other methods of transportation such as trains, buses, and subways. We can all agree that this would be great and would help out a lot with trying to reduce our CO2 emissions; we can also agree that unfortunately this will never happen. As Ken said cars are “cool” and have been portrayed as cool for many years now. If you ever ask anyone what they hope to have in their future you of course get the basic answers of a good salary, a nice house, and of course a nice car. Cars are a huge part of our culture and I find it nearly impossible to change that. Besides that, another issue with people changing from cars to these other methods of transportation is the convenience that comes with a car. A car is much more convenient than a train/bus/subway because you can move around on your time unlike trains/buses/subways which have certain times for picking people up and have schedules to follow. Well then you can argue to get a bike, but that also loses to a car when it comes to convenience. A bike is of course not as fast, not as spacious, and would be bad for certain weathers, such as the rain. 
<br><br>
 Overall, I completely agree with Ken, but I believe this is one of those changes required to combat the climate crisis that will be hard to actually make. Maybe I am just being too pessimistic, but for now this is the way I see it. Also, I know Ken gave us various benefits for giving up cars, but I think they are not enough.

I agree with this post in that Americans are very unlikely to change the way they get around due to convenience and our obsession with cars, along with this, our public transportation in America is so awful that no one will want to ever travel by train/bus/etc. because they are inefficient etc. I once took Amtrak from Chico to Los Angeles and it took me 17 hours. That's heinous, never again. However, I knew about the post-war car industries investing their money in creating a car culture and making it hard for mass transportation to develop and create a strong-hold in the U.S., and it deeply bothers me. We have allowed them to make public transport seem so unappealing that we are willing to risk the health of our planet for a Honda Civic. Until we make a United States High Speed Rail System that actually works, is affordable and doesn't take 17 hours, I feel as if people will not be willing to make the switch. What's worse is that we have to make the switch, like really have to, and we won't. Maybe if we implement some sort of legislation, but we won't. It's America and all our politicians really seem to care about is how much money and power they can accumulate, so....

<br><hr>

I really agree with what you said and I too am unfortunately pessimistic of the situation as well. I was shocked by the unsustainability of electric cars. I had been blind to this fact as I really did think that they were our answer for the eco-friendly car future. The facts about how much CO2 this manufacturing releases needs to be more of common knowledge. This fact is not well-publicized as people are just excited they get to claim they are saving the earth while driving the new and trendiest car. This definitely ties into the cool factor of cars that Ken presents as a cultural obstacle we need to break down. A car in America has become such a status symbol for a person that I think this structure will be hard to break down. It really is a shame that so much time was spent creating these electric cars that really are not the answer because our time is so precious and we can't afford to waste time anymore. 
<br><br>
It makes total sense that buses, trains, and subways are a much better option for our earth. While I knew this, I didn't quite know how much better they really were. It really is so sad that this eco-friendly option that is sitting right in front of us is so stigmatized and unglamorous for the average/ above average American. I also think that beyond un-stigmatizing these systems, we as a country, would have to dedicate a huge sum of money to create a better public transportation system that is realistic for most citizens to utilize. I know personally, my city's public transportation was nowhere near where it needed to be as it really only extended to specific parts of the city. I just can't imagine our government allotted a huge sum of money to upgrade this system nationally, especially with our obsession with cars. For that reason is why I am pessimistic to see change near for this issue. 
<br><br>
I also was very interested in the point that Ken made about the importance of the humanities view of this issue. Proof is so important and the scientists doing the research on this climate crisis are obviously vital. However, I had never really thought about how figuring out how we, as humans, let these stats get to where they are is just as important of an issue. This excites me as I have never been much a stem person, but there is still important work to be done on this humanities, cultural side of things.
<br><hr>
That’s true. Before watching this lecture videos, I never think of how much emissions that manufacture of electric car will produce. I believe that most people like me will think that electric car is more environmental friendly, but the reality is that it actually makes more pollution than the traditional gasoline car. There exists more facts that are on the opposite of what people are thinking of. The talking between the benefits of owning a car and bad effects to the environment is also impressive. It is indeed a good idea to stop owning car to produce less pollution to the environment, but it is almost impossible for people who have already enjoyed the convenience and pleasure the car brings to them to give up owning a car. There are little people like Thoreau who can follow the minimalism and enjoy living with the nature.


<br><Hr>
I agree with you. Through out the lecture, Ken has repeatedly mentioned that the climate crisis is not as much of a technology problems as it is a cultural problem. He stated that simply advancing the technology of what Americans desires is not enough to solve the climate crisis, only if we change what is popular in the current culture will we be able to deal with the problem from the root. It really blew my mind when Ken said that if we just buy a car in every 11 years and just park it in the garage, we have already used up the carbon footprint of our entire life. 
<br><hr>
What Ken said makes complete sense to me but I feel like there is still a long way to go to achieve that ideal world. But I'm glad that most of us are staring to acknowledge that.
<br><br>
I really agree with your statement that public transportation will never become the norm, and that cars will always rule. Personally, I don't own a car and as someone who has used public transportation as the main form of travel, I'm looking to change that. Riding a bus or a train  isn't the best experience. They're packed, they take long to arrive, and simply waste my most valuable asset which is time. I agree that unfortunately cars will continue to be a source of the climate crisis as they are simply too convenient, and it would simply be too difficult to get enough people on board with that to make a significant impact.


<br><hr>
It's a difficult change for those who live in places where cars are the most efficient way to transport. Thinking of my parents who live in a suburb, driving fifteen minutes to work and back every day, they truly don't have many options. The lives that people worked hard for are not going to be substituted without a fight. It would take a whole community to make this change realistic and functional.
<br><br>
The hopeful part about this message is that this generation can make sustainable transportation a norm. We are either working or in college; we haven't settled down into a suburb or have a career that we are obligated to. We have the ability to form our lives around the climate crisis. If the United States could decrease the popularity and desire for cars, I believe that momentum would carry us to solve climate issues further. Professor Hiltner's explanation of this cultural problem already has me considering lifestyle options in the near future. The ways that my generation chooses to form their lives will play a significant role in the breakaway from cars. The easiest route, following in our parents footsteps, is also the most dangerous route. We need to repave the cultural values by migrating towards cities or finding alternative lifestyles that can be sustainably supported.
<br><hr>
 I have read your comment and I totally agree with it. I also felt what you have felt after viewing this video. As we mentioned and talked in the lecture. Cars are a huge problems in our world, in the United States, people owns the most cars in the world. It can emit tons of CO2 in everyday to our atmosphere. Thus, our environment are becoming worse. In China, the government   limits the car by the end number of the cars. In this way, those people who only have one car chose to ride bikes, trains, or subways. This policy made the traffic easier and release less traffic. But some rich people starts to buy more than one car to make sure they can drive everyday. It's hard to solve this problem in one day or two days, because cars are an important part in our life. I believe the government has to get involved to solve this problems, for example, the government can educate the youth to ride more bikes, trains, and subways or some public transportations instead of using their private cars.
<br><hr>




I agree with the statements above. I liked how specific this lecture video was, and the statistics Ken mentioned as it serves as a slap in the face of how much we exceed our carbon footprint. The facts I found most interesting was the list of how much each type of car emits carbon dioxide during the production. When Ken mentioned how owning a car already makes you emit more than the carbon footprint your suppose to have, I didn't think about the amount of carbon dioxide goes into our atmosphere during the production of this mobiles-- which our culture pressures us into getting. I have seen numerous pictures on social media of celebrities with more than 5 luxurious cars and being so proud of their accomplishment (why is having more than one car mean you've become a success?) and I use to admire them and want their success and to be able to buy all these nice cars. However, after learning more about our climate crisis, I now realize that I can't fall within this lifestyle and I instead feel like they are setting the wrong image for the future generations. Anyways, back to the main subject, I do agree with your point that cars are part of our culture and it will be really hard for our society to change their mode of transportation. But I believe if majority were to change their transportation methods and the governments improve and enforce public transportation then we can change the culture and help save the planet. But its all the matter of the everyone working together.


<br><hr>

I completely agree with your point about the climate solution being one of new cultural ideologies rather than new technologies. And while it may be challenging to reverse the American appeal of cars, enough social change can sway public opinion. Just as how the campaign for cars required extensive marketing and working closely with the government, the move away from cars can be successful by using similar techniques. This is especially feasible in cities and more concentrated areas of urban development where people do not typically have to travel long distances in their daily lives. In many other cities around the world, their public transportation systems are a lot more efficient, and thus more people use them over cars. If the US channeled more funds into making public transportation more accessible, cleaner, and able to run more frequently, it may be a more appealing option than driving a car. However, a major issue with public transportation in the US is the large amount of people living in suburban areas. In these areas, carbon emissions can still be cut on an individual level by choosing smaller cars over SUVs and deciding to carpool. On a government level, they can allocate funds for better bike lanes and bike racks. While these options are not as ideal as busses or trains, they are still better alternatives for suburban areas. After all, a small change in the right direction is better than no change at all out of fear that one cannot live a perfectly green life and should not even bother trying.

 As someone who uses there car solely when they need to but for long distances when necessary I have a hard time with this idea. I understand that car emission contribute to most of the CO2 emitted and that it makes up most of my carbon footprint but without using my car I would not be able to conveniently see important people in my life. I am in a long distance relationship and I also live in a city apart from him and UCSB so when I travel I travel far. Because I travel far in order to see said people I try to limit my driving while at school as a way to save on gas an limit my carbon footprint. While on campus I ride my bike to get around or I walk to my destination as a way to eliminate my footprint while trying to take the bus if I have to go downtown or to the store. While for some people the idea could be ideal and could very easily work, it would not be ideal for those who live in the already developed suburbs and rural areas. While there are the alternatives of buses and trains, a train ticket can be just as expensive both ways as a tank of gas and it exposes you to illness and other human related diseases. I personally have taken the train as a way to get home and while it felt like a long journey it was better than sitting in LA traffic. Taking the bus downtown will take longer than driving but it lets you out by your destination without you having to worry about parking.

I believe that once I graduate from college and start settling down within my profession and life that I will transport less and be able to reduce my carbon footprint. Taking the bus from one location to another in town can be convenient as it allows you to arrive worry free about parking and costs less than a tank of gas that dwindles with every location you go to. A lot of people I believe enjoy the personal space and freedom of driving a car and sadly I think it will be hard to convince the world to lower their car emission as they believe it to be a crucial way of life. Car companies have created electric cars and even though they gained some popularity they did not gain enough to create a large enough impact on the world. I feel that a lot of change would come from reduction of car use and it would all be positive but even though it would be positive it is not enough to spark a revolution of change among the people to reduce their carbon emissions. I do agree though that we need to find a new way of transportation that could solve all the problems we are facing right now.

I agree, at first I had a difficult time with the proposal to cut cars out of our lifestyle. How am I suppose to travel as easily? I began to realize my problem with this proposal is that our current society makes it easier for us to have cars as opposed to using public transit or other alternatives. Rather than investing in cars we should, as a society, invest in better and more public transportation. Currently public transit and biking is more convenient for those who live in the city, but as someone who also lives in the suburbs these methods for transportation aren't often available. While cities have much lower carbon footprints than the suburbs, we can't force everyone to move to a city. Therefore, if we want to cut down the footprint of suburban areas, we have to bring public transport to them. If there were easier ways to get to work for people who don't live in the city, much more people would turn to these methods as well. This would ultimately reduce the carbon footprint of suburban areas while inclining these people to turn away from owning cars.

 I'm not going to lie, I find Ken’s perspective here to be rather idealistic.  While I can understand that a cultural change would result in a larger overall change, I don’t know how realistic it is to think of that as a possibility.  As he stated, the desire to have a car is so great within our culture, that many people own more than one.  It’s become embedded within our culture so deeply, driving is viewed as a rite of passage, a freedom that most people will not be willing to give up.  Meanwhile, Elon Musk is out here, creating Cyber Trucks which are going to be much more appealing to the average American than riding the bus and train.  This being said, I do think there is a lot we can do to increase the number of Americans who use public transportation. All of my Senior year of high school, I took the bus home from school.  It took a total of 2 hours, when usually a car ride home would be about 15 minutes.  The bus stop I walked to was a mile away from my school campus, and then the closest bus stop to my house was also a mile.  It cost me $35 a month.  When I went home this Winter break, I discovered that my hometown, San Diego, had raised bus fares to $2.50 each way with no option to get transfer tickets.  These are all things that in all honesty, make me not want to use public transportation. In order to get more people on board with this form of transportation, the cost needs to go down, more stops need to be offered, and they need to be in better conditions.  Public transportation may never be culturally viewed as “cool,” but I believe that these are all things that could increase the public’s participation in public transportation.  

<br><br>
Something I did very much like about this lecture, is it really broke down for me in number form the amount of emissions which a singular person causes.  I think many people do know that the numbers are large and much more than they should be, but really presenting it to us like this was eye-opening to me for sure.  For example, the fact that manufacturing an electric vehicle can produce so much greenhouse gases, and that on average, purchasing a car alone fulfills your CO2 allotment yearly.  Something else which stood out to me was looking at the cultural differences of Western culture v. Eastern.  I think that a lot of the time, the United States looks upon ourselves as the model country, when in reality we are exactly the opposite of that environmentally.

I completely agree with what you said about Ken’s approach to this issue; the idea of having no cars in our society is an unfortunately impractical goal for the short time period that we have to deal with the pressing threats of climate change. Yes, all of those statistics are very frightening and truly show the damage that cars do to our planet, but I think the focus should be on lessening their impact. Like you said, cars are deeply rooted into our culture, and it will take a lot of time and effort before cars aren’t a symbol of freedom and adventure. That being said, through reforming the public transportation system, the amount of cars in existence can decrease. 
<br><br>

As you mentioned in your comment, raising bus fares made you want to use public transportation less, and I agree that this is definitely an issue. I think that in order for people to really start to use public transportation (specifically buses), it should be free to use, and therefore paid for by the government. Yes, right now it is much cheaper than paying for a car and its expenses, but if it was free for the consumer, they might realize just how much they would save on transportation if they took the bus. It might be a long shot, but given the consumer’s attachment to their private vehicle, public transportation must be presented in the best light possible. Additionally, I believe that both the conditions and accessibility must be reformed; people are so drawn to the convenience and comfort of their own cars, but if public transportation were to raise its standards, I think that more people would be inclined to use it.

 This video lecture was the most eye-opening one we have watched so far. I did not know how much electric cars hurt our environment, purely because of how it is manufactured. Tesla always advertises its “zero emission cars” which I think is a great step in the right direction, but it still emits 15%-68% more CO2 than gas cars in the manufacturing process. I found this very shocking and a bit hypocritical because this doesn’t make teslas zero emission cars overall. Even without driving a car and just keeping it in your driveway, this would emit 2 metric tons of CO2 which is the amount we are supposed to emit per person per year if we want to not change the climate by more than 2 degrees celsius globally. This is crazy to think about because this doesn’t include all of our other needs, such as food, clothing, shelter, and even just driving the car. I think this really shows how important minimalism is in preserving our earth especially. 
<br><BR>

Rather than trying to create a truly zero emission car (including production, which is basically impossible) we need to change people’s mindset regarding taking mass transit. People feel like they have to buy cars because it is “cool” and gives them freedom, but this mindset is horrible for the environment and for ourselves. We need to see the benefits of mass transit. As Ken mentioned, taking the bus is 14 times more efficient than taking a car, and 3 out of 4 cars only have 1 person in the car. People don’t care about the pollution their cars emit because for the most part they are extremely selfish (myself included). 
<br><Br>

Another interesting point Ken mentioned in the video is how the average American spends 9000 dollars a year to take care of their car and pay for it, and if they instead put this money into a retirement fund since their early 20s, they could retire by their 40s. This is the real freedom that Americans should desire. Although mass transit is not a very convenient option for people in many smaller cities and towns, walking and biking can also be another sustainable option if possible. Ken also stated how traffic injuries are a worldwide epidemic and we are basically paying for a “death trap” so why not look into other options that are safer, more sustainable, and cost a lot less.

The Tesla statistics are quite surprising, along with the rest of the misinformation surrounding electric cars. What a solid reminder that, no matter how pure and innovative a product might seem, when stemming from consumerism it is all still about money. The capitalistic gain and marketing schematics will always outweigh the truth, and it is frightening to hear that this is the case with electric cars. Unfortunately, this is the first time the pointlessness of electric cars has been brought to my attention. While I am proud to say I have been more and more upset about Telsa's cars' "innovations" that they implement due to the unnecessary lavishness that is reminiscent of Apple's clever changes in power cords, I was also entirely under the impression that electric cars were part of the answer. It hadn't even crossed my mind that their manufacturing might be less sustainable, and while I know that their charging requires a lot of electricity, it still seemed safe to assume that anything is better than smog and pollution being guzzled into our air. 
<br><br>
Cars really do represent freedom in the social climate we have. And, not sure if it's just me but, cities have always been a bit of a turn off. It most definitely must be cultural brainwashing, but suburbs and space are much more inviting than cities that mirror the crowded conditions of early industrialization and dirty colonies we learn of in elementary history. First train tracks, then automobiles, then interstate highways; all grand achievements that make America a place open with opportunity. However, as you bring up, the financial burden a personal transportation vehicle can have really does take away from this supposed freedom. More evidence of cultural brainwashing: that it makes you more free to have more than to do more. One would be able to do and go as much via public transportation, spending less money too, with adequate planning and patience. It seems that the true issue with our culture is that of instant gratification and the necessity for excess. We are taught that independence, self-sufficiency, and happiness require expensive earnings and fast paced living, and it is slowly ruining us all.
<br><hr>
I felt very similar while watching this lecture video. I feel like many people, myself included, often do not take time to recognize that the products we buy have already had a huge impact on carbon emissions from their process of manufacturing. Like the video pointed out, even if you buy a car and never use it, you have already released 2 metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, not to mention the included emissions released as soon as you do drive it. Many people choose to buy electric cars, thinking that without needing gasoline, it will be better for the environment. Sadly, the manufacturing of electric cars produces 15-68% more emissions than normal cars. This just proves to me that in order to dramatically reduce carbon emissions in the future, we need to convince people to move away from cars and turn to other forms of transportation. 

<br><br>
As America stands right now, it will be very difficult to get people to ditch their cars due to the fact that our public transportation systems are very inadequate. Compared to places like Asia or Europe, where public transportation accounts for billions of riders per year, the US falls behind drastically. This is because our public transport systems are run down, inefficient, and underfunded. Imagine how much better it would be if US industry stopped focusing on producing bigger and “better” cars, and instead put those resources into making trains and buses more efficient and more wide ranging. The only way to shift our car-dependent society is to create better infrastructure for public transportation.

 The opening to this video had me surprised as I didn’t think electric cars where so bad, but after thinking about it closely to does make sense to use what we have now such as busses, cars, and bikes to get around oppose to inventing other ways. Electric cars at the time to me seemed like the way to go if you wanted to get around, but now I know that public transportation is the better way of all. No one in my family drives so if we wanted to get around we had to walk or take the bus/train and I think that has made me used to these forms but for anyone else that moves through car might find it harder to give up that way of commuting. I actually am not a fan of commuting through bus and that is due to the one time I was kicked by homeless lady for talking too much and too loudly so I would opt for commuting by car if I could. So I understand why some people may not want to give up this luxury but in the end it won’t be a luxury if we don’t have a sustainable earth to live on. I think we do need to make changes that do no result in making more material products, BUT actually making use of the effective products we have now such as train/bus.

I also found the notion that electric cars are not as beneficial as they may seem interesting. Prior to watching this lecture, I believed, along with a majority of people, that the move towards a large influx of electric cars was the way to go in regards to reducing the release of carbon dioxide. I had never really thought about all of the materials and energy that go into producing cars in general. However, now it makes much more sense that there should be a move towards public transportation and the use of current, already-in-existence methods, rather than producing new vehicles, regardless of their fuel efficiency. Although this shift seems obvious and manageable in essence, the issue will always boil down to the lack of wanting to give up a comfortable and luxurious, and even just convenient, lifestyle. Many of those who have worked hard to be as successful as they are, or even those who have simply been lucky enough to receive their wealth, refuse to give up the luxuries that accompany their fortunes, such as driving fancy cars, or just cars in general. They hold false beliefs that people of their supposed ‘status’ should not take advantage of public transportation simply because they might not need to. It seems that the only way to move away from this false sense would be to redefine why public transportation exists. Rather than being connected with the idea that only those who need this transportation should take it, there should be a shift to convey it is the planet that is in need, and it is our responsibility to help.


<br><hr>
I really admire your and your family’ life style. Many people think that private cars are more convenient and comfortable than public transportation. They only care about efficiency and quality of life instead of protecting environment.We could analysis this phenomenon based on two different kinds of people.1) The first kind of people are who ignore the environment problem. They have no intention to learn more about the climate change and ignore information from social media. These are the reason why they do not know the seriousness of the climate change. For this kind of people, we should tell them the current situation and advocate them to spread information t a broader range. 2) Another type of people are those who know what a big problem the climate change is, but they think a person would not impose any effect to this situation. However, what they do not realize is that other people will have the same thought. One person’s power is weak, but if everyone do like this, the power is unlimited. We should use this power to prevent climate change and keep the situation to be constant.

 After watching this video, Im finding myself at a major crossroads in what I thought I knew about the climate crisis. I am understanding the problems behind electric cars now that Ken has explained the statistics of the CO2 emissions from them, however, I do not think it is the right thing to say that "electric cars are more trouble than good". The reason I disagree with his statement is because it is going to take a milestone that the world realistically is simply not capable of to omit the use of cars completely or even significantly. With this being said, electric cars still are a better option than gas operated vehicles and are the only real solution we have at the moment other than different types of transportation. If people start to believe that they are "more trouble than good", then all the efforts people have attempted to make to contribute to helping this crisis because they thought they were doing something good due to what supposedly trusted sources have told us, will go straight down the drain and make people give up. I think it is safe to say that switching to an electric car is one of the easiest perceived and desirable lifestyle changes a person could make to contribute to the cause which is why so many people have made the change. If we now tell everyone that they were wrong and have actually been hurting more than helping, it could send them back into thinking that these changes people are insinuating to make are bogus and that they should just keep to their normal lifestyle. 
<br><br>
I think the major idea that should be taken from this clip is the fact that we really do not have a grasp on what is actually good and what is actually bad for the environment and for this change we are trying to make. For years now, electric cars have been the talk of the town preaching that they will save the world and now people are like...just kidding? While we still do not know the true solutions, I do not think we should bash those that do help more in comparison to previous lifestyles even if they still aren't perfect because in the end this whole situation is still a major work in progress that needs major tweaking.

I agree with this statement. The purpose of having electric cars is to reduce the amount of emissions produced by cars, not eliminate the emissions completely, It would be great if that happened, but the technology in today's society cannot allow for this, electric cars will have to do. I believe that if we keep having the mentality of that electric cards do "more trouble than good", then we will only go backwards. It will be a pessimistic thought that will cause people to refrain from switching to electric cars at all and then just buy cars with more emissions. The main takeaway from this video should be that yes, electric cards reduce emissions, but the manufacturing process still also produces emissions. With this new knowledge, a lot of people will be able to understand that emissions can also come from the manufacturers as well. This knowledge is important going forward as people will change how frequent they buy new cars in order to reduce emissions from manufacturing. But, I agree with you in the way that we should not promote the "electric cars can do more harm than good" mentality.

 I had never really thought about the culture behind why we drive cars over mass transit until this video. Sure, it is easier to drive cars and not be surrounded by lots of others, but they are also economically unfeasible and unsustainable. Therefore we need to rechange the way we think about cars and also get the federal government to do the same. I agree that instead of investing in technology to make zero emission cars, which still produce heavy amounts of greenhouse gases during manufacturing, we need to focus on shifting our time and money to building up public transportation. I think this may be a hard task, because as we have seen with other sectors like fossil fuels, the automobile corporations are going to try to lobby politicians to prevent this from happening. And without the necessary public transportation structure people, mostly in the suburbs, will continue to use cars because it will be easier for them to use cars. As someone who lived in a suburb, I can not imagine solely relying on public transportation simply because there was a very limited amount of it around. 
<br><br>
However if we could make this change, it would be extremely beneficial to our environment and reduce our carbon footprints by 1/4th. As Ken said, in order to meet the Paris Climate Accord goal of a 2 degree Celsius rise, we cannot contribute more than 2 m tons of emissions per year. Just buying a car and owning it for 11 years, not even driving it would keep us at that level, which is clearly not sustainable enough. I found it interesting that the trend of cars becoming cool was due to the increased industrialization of World War 2 and needing to keep that industry going for our economy to thrive. Therefore the government sold the idea that living in the suburbs was more ideal, which would require cars. If we could get people to make the switch to suburbs and cars, hopefully we can do the opposite and invest into public transportation and sustainable travel by convincing the public that cars are not cool.

I too grew up in a suburb and I also think that a majority of students grew up in suburbia as well. Ken argues that we need to change our culture to make buses, trains, subways and public transport seem cool. How is that going to happen? I feel like the majority of California is suburb. One of the reasons I hate LA is because it just sprawling suburb as far as the eyes can see. How are we suppossed to change our culture when our culture and cities are already built around cars? I'm pessimistic and don't see this happening. People are infatuated with cars and suburbia life. California to me is just one giant suburb with out any decent public transit. I wish were more like Europe and had amazing train system and built cities around bikes and public transit. My plan when I grow up is to move to a city and live in a small apartment and use public transit so I don't kill the environment.

 In this video, I am very surprised that the number of cars owned by China has increased by 10000% in only 3 years. And the video said that people have always wanted to use the power of science and technology to prevent climate change. Now I find that this is unlikely. With the continuous progress of science and technology, the demand for resources is getting higher and higher, and the harm to the environment will gradually deepen. Like the electric vehicle mentioned in the video, before the appearance of the electric vehicle, people thought that the electric vehicle would contribute to the protection of the environment. In fact, in the production process of the electric vehicle, a large number of greenhouse gases will be emitted, which also has an impact on climate change. So many examples show that the progress of science and technology will only aggravate the impact of climate change. As the video said, we need to study our current cultural practices and make changes in people's minds to cope with climate change.

I agree with what you said about how science and technology will only aggravate the impact of climate change. Personally, I believe that our reliance on technology to reverse the damage we have caused will only further deepen our problems. Yes, the creation of electric cars have, in many ways benefited American’s lifestyle, however, it has also increase our carbon footprint as a whole. The plans we have enacted to reduce our carbon foot print have only worked in a way that has increased it. You also brought up a really great point as to how we need to look at how our cultural practices only further impacts our contribution to the climate crisis. In a way, we have all been conditioned that driving a car and being less co-dependent is the way of life. So in order to change peoples minds, we must normalize the things we have been conditioned to stigmatized.

 Before taking this class I had known that electric cars were more trouble than good but I was told that the production of the electric car would overstate the C02 amount that it would save (from gasoline). However, after watching this video I was so surprised that it actually does save in the long run but the actual reason it causes such trouble is because of actually buying the car causes you to go over the amount of c02 emissions we should be emitting in our lifetime while the car may just be sitting on your driveway. The infatuation of cars is causing climate change to worsen even if we focus our attention on cars that are “emission-free” it is still costing us pollution. We should focus on car usage and buy efficient used cars that will last long in order to reduce the number of cars produced. 
<br><br>
I really liked how the lecture instead focuses on cultural problems. I found it amazing that we can travel 350 miles on just one gallon of gas on a bus or a train. I totally agree that the reason the U.S. drives so much is because it is so “trendy”. We must bring in social sciences into this in order to try to transform mass transformation into an appealing trend. Our society is so infatuated with what's cool that if we could make things “cool” that help the environmentally significantly we could transform the environment (although maybe for the wrong reasons but it still makes it work). I found this lecture very interesting as I have never thought that climate change could be caused by cultural factors (of course besides fast fashion) and I think this is a factor we need to consider in order to mitigate climate change.

I wonder if this lecture ignores a multitude of things that could be done to own a car with less of a footprint. You could buy a used electric car, that car was already made, and now you just have to deal with the charging. You could maintain your car, so it lasts more than 11 years. (My parents just retired their car from the eighties this year. 11 years seems so short.) You could share a car. I know barely anyone who owns a car all to themselves. Cars are often shared by families.
<br><br>
Sure, I would still prefer mass transit, but it needs to be understood that not everyone can live without a car. People who live in rural areas, people who work odd hours, and people with mobility issues could all have issues with public transportation. But this isn't to say that you should own a car just because you can. If you can use public transportation or a bike: do so.
<br><br>
I think an interesting social experiment to create cultural change is if a social media influencer started posing with bikes or busses instead of cars. How would that change how we see cars? One aspect of cars I've always loved is the customization (like the pink car with the hello kitty design in the video.) but we can and should do that with bikes as well. UCSB is the biggest bike school there is. Let's start that trend!

<br><hr>
I agree with how the infatuation of cars in American society is causing climate change to worsen, whether it be“emission-free” vehicles or not. Both of these are polluting the planet with carbon dioxide. Cars account for one fourth of our individual carbon footprint; therefore, Ken urges that we use the efficient sources of transportation that we already have at hand such as buses, subways, trains, walking, and biking. These environmentally friendly forms of transportation would cut our carbon footprint drastically but to be realistic we are in need of our vehicle to get around faster and more comfortably. For this reason I really liked your suggestion on buying used cars. I thought this was a great idea for we will be reducing the number of cars produced. This reminded me of clothes thrifting which is really popular. We would be encompassing the same idea but in cars. If United States citizens viewed used cars as trendy, imagine the impact that would have in shaping our society and transforming the environment. 
<br><br>
It is clear that we are relying on technology to solve the climate crisis and electric cars are an example on this issue. A big takeaway from this lecture is that we need to institute cultural practices over technology. It is absurd to know that the United States holds only four percent of the world's population but fifty percent of the world’s cars.

After watching this video, I realized that there is still a lot of effort needed to be put in if we want to truly be environment-friendly and to live a high quality life simultaneously. It is not new for me to know that hybrid car production still produces greenhouse gas even though hybrid cars emit less carbon dioxide than traditional cars do, but I had no idea of how mass the amount of greenhouse gases generated by electric car production is. As a result, hybrid cars can’t be the solution to our climate issue until we find a way to reduce the carbon dioxide emission during the car production. The true solution is to change the way we see about public transportation.
<br><br>
According to Professor Hiltner, nowadays we have more cars than licensed drivers, which means that some drivers possess more than one car. In China, the number of cars owned increases 10,000% in only three decades. With the increase in standards of life and our expectations of life quality, cars become more popular and common seen. The problem is that we choose to drive even though public transportation is usually more efficient and eco-friendly. What needs to change is how we view cars and public transportation, and that this is a cultural issue. It’s pretty hard to do because owning a car brings so much convenience to our lives: no need to catch a bus, don’t have to carry groceries by hand, privacy, and a lot more. What make this cultural problem hard is that we have to compare the benefits and the downside of driving a car.

Just like the production of hybrid cars, electric car production also produces tons of CO2 even though during transmission it technically produces “zero emission.” Because of this knowledge, I find it so ironic when a person purchases a new Tesla, and before the arrival of the license plate, the plate frame on the back of the car usually has the ZERO EMISSION sign on it. I find it very difficult to come up with a new way to reduce CO2 during car production because the automobile industry is always striving for something new and something exciting to keep up with consumer demands and the market. Usually these new and exciting things could be additional accessories that would require prolonged process of production that results in unnecessary CO2 emission. 
<br><br>
I believe the reasons for more cars than licensed drivers in the US are due to car collectors as well as families that think they need separate cars for work and vacation. Speaking of car collectors, it reminds me of the film, Minimalism, of this week when Ryan and Joshua were talking about people that collect books. Honestly, besides showing off to friends and family, these additional items do not hold any other purpose in my opinion. The problem in China where car ownership skyrocketed also reflects one of the points from Minimalism where production is cheaper because of the low-cost manual labor. Car ownership reflects individual wealth but just thinking about the cost of maintaining a vehicle gives me a headache. I do own a car and let me tell you what I have to do to keep this thing running… Last year, my brake pads went out so that was $500… A year before that my air conditioning broke down, another $1,000. My neighbor dented my bumper: $600. Monthly car insurance $70 and don’t even get me started with gas… I honestly wish I don’t have to be dependent on my car…
<br><hr>


I really liked what you said about how cars “brings so much convenience to our lives” because I was constantly thinking that same thing when watching this lecture. That particular point is what kind of makes me disagree with some aspects of Professor HIltner’s idea with solving the car problem. But, I do agree with the fact that the best way to reduce CO2 emissions created by cars is to completely stop driving cars. However, I feel like that is never going to happen. I think encouraging the idea to use your car less or not at all is a good idea, but people are always going to want to drive their car. Hiltner states that people spend about $9,000 a year to maintain a car and that that money could be put away and saved and used for something better, but people also have to pay for public transportation and it’s not really all that Hiltner is making it out to be. You’re traveling with strangers, sitting in close quarters, and every time I’ve taken the bus there is at least one person doing drugs in the bathroom. It’s not always a safe and reliable way of transportation, since sometimes buses and trains get delayed. I do want to emphasize that I think no cars is the best way of reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, but I just feel like that won’t happen overnight.

Hiltner says that electric cars aren’t all that great either, since manufacturing them also creates CO2. But, would he rather people drive normal cars or electric cars, because people are going to continue to drive regardless. This is obviously a cultural issue that I think won’t be solved by completely eliminating driving cars, but he says that technology also cannot solve it. I don’t think electric cars are completely solving the issue, but I think it definitely helps. I feel like it is a good transition to slowly cutting out the use of our cars completely. I think Hiltner has a good intent when saying cars should be completely eliminated, but I also think it’s a little extreme and he doesn’t take into consideration all of the other factors of owning a car.

 I do agree with Ken that climate change is in large part a cultural/societal issue in America. However I think there is a possibility to solve (at least for the car example he provides) certain aspects of climate change. For example if a producer was able to produce a car whose carbon emissions per year were relativity zero, including production then consumers would still have the ability to drive that many people love without having to worry about their environmental impact. However the production of such a car would most likely be very costly for the producer and thus some of that cost would be pushed on to the consumer which would result in consumers having a low demand for such a high priced car. That is unless consumers valued the car's ability to net produce zero emissions worth the cost. Therefore if a car manufacturer was able to produce a car for a low price, with close to net zero emissions, and then be able to convince consumers to move away from petrol-based automobile. While I understand that his is a large thing to ask from a company it is possible and would end up limiting carbon emissions by a lot if a firm was successful. The producer would also benefit as they would experience massive profits if they were the first company to make a car like this.

I was shocked after watching Ken's lecture video. In particular, he mentioned that the number of cars in China rose by 10,000% from 2007 to 2017. I know that many cars in China have a great impact on transportation and the environment, but I have never thought that this data is so scary. After I went to school in the United States, I found it necessary to own a car, but I did not expect that there were more cars in the United States than there were people with driver's licenses. I agree with Ken's point that the climate crisis is a cultural problem. With the advancement of science and technology, engineers and scientists are indeed thinking about how to make humans have more convenient means of travel, and they really ignore environmental issues. However, it is good to note that now more auto brands are admiring new energy vehicles, and burning gas will be less harmful to the environment than burning fossil fuels. There are also many and many cars now choosing to burn hydrogen, indicating that humans are beginning to realize that cars are harming the climate. As a college student who currently does not need a car as a means of travel, we should start with ourselves, take fewer taxis to school, use more buses or ride to school, and contribute to the environment.

 Watching this lecture video reminded me a lot of a conversation I had with my dad this last weekend, who was one of many boomers born out of the post world war two economy.  We, somewhat ironically, were driving from Los Angeles to San Diego in a rental car for a family gathering and got to talking about a lot of the things I had learned from this class over the first three weeks of the quarter.  I found it very interesting to hear his perspective on the climate crisis as while he is definitely environmentally conscious and aware of the issue, he still thought of the problem in a previous generation way.  I realized this interesting difference between how the younger and older generations view climate change when we got to talking about cars and their impact on the environment.  He has always been a liberal, and recognized how important an issue climate change was for the world, but told me that through the majority of his life he and his peers viewed the principle issue of climate change to be the driving of gas guzzling cars as our transportation.  We talked for awhile about this, or more so I taught him a lot of what I've learned from this class, and it seemed that initially he believed that new electric based vehicles would solve a substantial issue of our emission of greenhouse gasses.
<br><br>

I can see how he and much of his generation would believe this, that the mass driving of cars was the main issue and that new technologies of electric vehicles would be the solution.  After all every day we see hundreds if not thousands of cars driving by us, and the pollution from them is the most visible kind of our carbon footprint we can see from our everyday lives.  But this is of course a false belief, the pollution from our cars being only about a quarter of our yearly carbon footprint, and electric cars only cutting that quarter down to an eighth.  I spent a lot of the car ride with my dad telling him about just how much worse the climate crisis is than most of his generation believes it to be, along with why it is that way.  It is interesting to me that even people such as my father, a liberal vegetarian boomer who believes climate change is one of the biggest issues facing our nation and planet, do not fully understand the severity of the problem or changes that need to be made to solve them.  How we can convey this to the older generations is beyond me, but I found it to be a nonetheless interesting observation.

 After watching this lecture video I had a few initial reactions. My first reaction is that I did not realize how much electric cars do not help very much in reducing greenhouse emissions. I had an understanding before this video on how fully electric cars still would emit CO2 emissions during construction and the fact that cars do not last a whole lifetime, but what I didn't know were the statistics behind this and how great these emissions can be. What really struck home was when Professor Hiltner described how car manufacturing still releases about 22 metric tons of CO2 per car (a conservative estimate) and that cars have an average lifespan of 11 year. Combined with the fact aht if we want to live on a healthy planet, we should not emit over 2 tons of CO2 per year so even if we buy an electric car means that the emissions of creating a car that lasts 11 years takes up all of this limit (about 2 metric tons of CO2 emissions per year even if the car is electric). This made me realize the problematic situation at hand as electric cars are not the solution, but that the real solution lies in changing society’s use and culture around cars.
<br><br>
Although I was left slightly depleted after learning the ineffectiveness of the electric car solution I was left with some hope as the bright side of the situation is that this problem of car use in our society can be solved right now by anyone who takes action and rids their lives of cars. We do not need to wait around for new technology, we just need to change our lives and depend more reliably on biking, walking, and public transportation which are over tenfold more efficient than using cars to get around. So what is the solution? As Ken points out, we need to foster a culture where taking a bus or other form of public transportation is more accepted and is cooler than having and driving a car. Because of this, it is important that we involve humanities in having a larger impact on combating climate change to address this issue. If we look at the issue of climate change from a purely scientific standpoint we will miss the chance to address the societal norms that are creating tons and tons of greenhouse emissions. Instead by using technology and science to create more efficient and less damaging ways to generate electricity and utilizing people who specialize in the various fields of humanities to address society’s use of energy and transportation we can more comprehensively address the problem of our current climate crisis.

Before watching this video, I also believed that electric cars were one major solution to the climate crisis. Everything just seems environmentally right about them. I was dumbfounded watching this video and realizing that the manufacturing of electric cars to replace gasoline powered cars would be environmentally disastrous. I also found the statistic of cars outnumbering licensed drivers in the U.S. to be insane. Why do car companies continue making cars when this statistic exists and how are they selling them? The answer must be that one person must own more than one car. What would one person need more than one car for? It just doesn't make sense. A simple solution to the car crisis in America would be to improve public transportation. Why are we the richest country in the world and we still can't get from coast to coast with out a car or an expensive airline ticket? This country would rather spend more money on foreign policy rather than focus spending in America to improve American problems-the most major one at the time being climate change!
<br><hr>

I had the exact same thought as you did when watching this lecture video. When I first saw the title, I was confused as to how electric cars can be bad for the environment. I thought that the electric cars were supposed to be innovative, life-changing and better for the earth because they didn't require gas however, I was deeply wronged as pointed out in this video. I did not even realize that making the actual car would contribute to CO2 emissions and as much as it did - 22 metric tons of CO2 per car. That is insane and absolutely heartbreaking especially knowing how many cars we have in this modern era today. I agree with Ken that this is a cultural issue and that we really do need to change our lifestyles.

<br><br>
Ken also mentioned that using a car is pretty much pointless because we spend so much money on it every year, just to maintain it. This is not even buying and owning the vehicle yet, just to maintain it is already so expensive and as he said, could be spent or saved in better ways. The issue of car accidents was also brought up. I know Ken brought these issues with cars and car manufacturing to illustrate the problematic culture surrounding cars. But, the thing is that people don't think of those things when buying or using a car. They don't buy a car and say oh this could be put into my retirement or wow i might get into an accident today etc. they think of the freedom and the joy of owning one. It's all a status in the society we live in.
<br><hr>

I definitely shared your shock at how inefficient electric cars were despite their zero emissions. Because of this I thought about if there was any way to reduce the greenhouse emissions that are released during the production of electric cars. However because of how large the machines are that help put together the cars in factories like Testa’s for example they require a good amount of fuel to operate them. I thought about whether they could perhaps try and use electric machines but as someone who does not know a lot about science or electrical engineering I do not know how feasible this is realistically. Because of this, like you and Ken I turned to public transportation as the most realistic and efficient option to reduce the CO2 emissions that are a result of transportation. Hopefully local and state governments and eventually the federal government will realize the importance of public transportation in solving our issue of CO2 emissions and fund it properly so that we can create a cultural and societal shift from individual car drivers to sustainable and convenient public transportation.

 As our society continues to expand, so to will the amount of people on the freeways and in their cars. Eventually, it seems like commuting via car will be anything but convenient as the highways will be overrun with more vehicles. Our society’s love of cars will not change, and the culture set around this mode of transportation will only grow. You mentioned that in places like New York, public transportation and other modes of transportation including walking, biking, subway, bus, etc.. are the norm and that these methods are more environmentally conscious forms of transportation. While I do agree that these modes of transportation are much better for the environment, we have to take into account that, in the majority of the country, public transportation is under underfunded and disorganized. I was shocked to hear about just how much emissions are released by the creation of motor vehicles including electronic cars. For years now I have thought that electric cars had very little drawbacks and were significantly better for the environment than regular cars. In many aspects I was right, you highlighted that over the span of 11 years (the average lifespan of a car) electronic cars are about half as bad for the environment as regular cars. However, through advertising, I was under the impression that these cars were a godsend and only emitted CO2 at the rate using electricity emits (via burning of fossil fuels to create electricity). We as a society need to make public transportation more accessible, more efficient and more popular. Because in its current state, the only people using public transport currently, are those who can’t afford a car, have health problems, or live in New York.

 After watching “climate crisis is a cultural problem/ and why electric cars are more trouble than good.”, I am shocked by knowing that electric cars are not the best solution to drive “greenly”. In the past, I’ve always thought that if electric cars can become more popular than gasoline-based cars with a lower price and equal or better quality, people would like to buy electric cars which are environmental- friendly. One thing that I never imagine is that CO2 emissions during car manufacturing. As ken’s said, if using electric cars with a lot of CO2 emissions, it is better to focus changes on whether we should buy a car. Ken proposed that people should take public transportation more instead of driving cars, which is absolutely true. Public transportation can transport many more people at one time in comparison with cars do. 
<br><Br>
Plus, it is a cultural problem of choosing a car as a transportation tool. For the US, as Ken mentioned in the video, although driving a car caused over 50 million people having risks of injury or even being dead, people still would like to drive cars because it is cool. Besides the reason, I think that US transportation mostly relies on cars. There are many highways for cars and a few lines for subway or buses. When a city owns a little convenient subway or buses, driving a car with lower-priced gasoline is the best choice for people. If the US wants to shift from driving cars to take public transportation, it should build more subway and buses to connect each community (although it is hard though).

I agree with you. I used to think using electricity car would be at least temporary solution for lowering the CO2 emission, and with further development, we can view the electricity car as ultimate solution for the balance of demand of car and protection of environment. I never think about how much greenhouse gas will be emitted into the atmosphere while producing those cars, and that cars will continue to produce gas even being parked in the garage. Besides those accidents car crash had killed people, just the high cost producing those vehicles damages the environment should make people realize as soon as possible that we should reduce the frequency of using or even purchasing the cars. Bicycles and public transportations are always better solution than riding with car.

Actually electromobile is problematic. There is rumor (or it is not rumor. Who knows) saying that electromobile has dangerous radiation which could lead to cancer. There are even ‘hearsay’ saying that there were already electromobile taxi drivers having cancers after they change their taxi from fossil-fuel functioned to electromobile. However, electromobile are encouraged to use and replace fossil fuel car because it is environmental-friendly. It has no pollution. If the newspaper report story of electromobile causes cancer, no one will buy or drive electromobile. Therefore, there is not such news report.

American actually mainly depends on airplane, instead of private cars, or public transportation. Therefore, American’s public transportation are really bad. There is no on-time Amtrak train or city bus. However, if Americans travel less by airplane, instead, use the public transportation, improve the public transportation, there will be fewer people travel by the airplane or private cars. Airplane creates pollution that is in no way less than private cars or public transportation.

 The electric car problem mentioned by Ken in the lecture is very interesting and worth discussing. First of all, comparing public transportation such as buses and subways, we cannot deny the convenience and private space of cars. Moreover, owning a car is also a representative of social status in the current society--I think this is one of the reasons why cars are "cool". Second, from gasoline cars to electric cars, we have to admit that our technology is improving, and carbon dioxide emissions have been halved--although carbon emissions still exceed standards. I think it is unrealistic to stop the world from using cars or make people think that cars are not cool in a short time. It is undeniable that cars are the most convenient way for the public to travel. We don't need to wait for buses and subways at bus stations or subway stations, or wait for planes at airports—not to mention that it is expensive. Therefore, unless there is a perfect substitute for the car, it is difficult for the car to reduce its use significantly. Maybe we need to continue to rely on technological advances to develop alternatives to cars to reduce carbon emissions. Otherwise, we can only make our environment better by sacrificing our time, private space, and "coolness."

I am glad that Steven brought up some of the reasons people like cars because this is definitely important to consider for this discussion. Yes, cars are extremely convenient, private, and representative of social status. But I don’t agree with Steven’s conclusion that decreasing car use is not the answer. Obviously we are not going to be able to just stop car use, but we have to find some way to decrease it considerably. In his lecture, Hiltner explains why relying on technology improvement will not work. A few stats concerning this really hit me. Firstly, that the average car emits about 4.6 tons of CO2 a year, about a quarter of the average American footprint. Secondly, that about 22 tons of CO2 (and this is on the low end) are emitted in a car’s manufacturing. This is especially scary because this equates to about 2 tons a year per person (as the average car lasts 11 years). Hiltner had already explained that 2 tons of CO2 emitted a year per person should be the cap if we want to be sustainable. Thirdly, and lastly, that buses, subways, and trains are 14, 20, and 30 times more efficient than cars, respectively. This stat means that the solution is already in place; we just need to decide to accept it.

<br><hr>

The points Ken makes about electric cars, their use and the fact that they were presented as a technological solution to a problem we have (when they’re not entirely) is definitely eye-opening. I have to admit that for the longest time I have solely considered owning an electric car as they have been marketed to be a big step forward on the issue of climate change via their “zero emissions” statement. Prior to this video I had never considered how devastating the actual production process of building a car could continue to be for our environment. It is upsetting that these products along with many others are marketed to be “sustainable” alternatives and continue to be consumed by so many who believe they are making the best choice. While I wouldn’t shame anyone who has purchased what they think to be a more sustainable or “better for our planet” alternative product, I do agree that the real problem is cultural. I agree with Steven in that it is difficult to re-teach an entire population or culture that cars aren’t always a necessity, especially when this commodity is so closely tied to our social status or used as a symbol of wealth. I will however disagree with your opinion that cars are the “most convenient” form of transportation. I’m from the Bay Area where public transportation is used by so many; busses, trollies and trains are constantly running because of the amount of people who make use of public transport. The shift here can exist just about anywhere, in fact I’d say it’s more convenient for me to take the bus to UCSB’s campus or even ride my bike because there is so limited parking space and the expense of owning a permit/gas/insurance is quite high to drive my car around this city. When places start favoring public transport systems there is inevitably a shift in how we consume and vice verse. There are many existing substitutes for the car already and if we really think about the physical space we are taking up and waste we are adding via the car industry it is undeniable that cars are not the “most convenient”. 
<br><br>

I’d say your comment is an example of the lesson Ken is trying to teach, in a way you are asking for a technological advancement or more sustainable product capable of replacing the car when in fact that already exists. As I understood the lesson, the solution will always come down to how we consume and how much we consume, for example our car would likely be more efficient if we carpooled, drove less or simply opted for alternative transportation. This video overall gave me a new perspective on how it is we use vehicles to better our lives at the cost of damaging our planet, to think we use up the amount of Carbon footprint we should be allowed by just purchasing a car makes me realize the negatives heavily outweigh the positives of owning, using and maintaining this transportation method.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with you. There must be a reason why so many people decide to drive. On one hand is the slow, noise buses, on the other hand, is the fast, clean cars. Which one would you choose? The answer is quite obvious. In addition, in order to let people think that cars are no longer cool, neither designing bad cars nor designing awesome buses are practical. In fact, teachers can teach students the knowledge of climate crisis (just like Ken ^^), governments can appeal for caring for our beautiful earth, and the people who care about the environment would take public transportation more frequently.
<br><br>
I agree with your statement that it is unrealistic to stop the world from using cars. True. At somewhere, sometime, we definitely have to use cars. However, in my opinion, I do not think that rely on technology to develop alternatives to cars can reduce carbon emissions because like Ken said in the video, creating a car already releases two metric tons of CO2. Therefore, the key here is not inventing new vehicles, is sustainable energy, or changing our cultural practices to reduce carbon emissions. Discovering sustainable energy needs a lot of time but changing behavior only needs a few seconds in our minds.

 This video really solidified the idea that change is inevitable. We can not expect electric cars or Elon Musk to solve our problems since they are much deeper than the average person knows. I feel extremely guilty after learning all those horrifying statistics about the negative effects of cars. I definitely knew that cars had very large negative effects on the environment, but when it came down to thinking of my own actions in the past that I did without thinking twice I felt ashamed. Living in Santa Barbara as a student has made living more sustainably so much easier without even noticing it. I, much like many other freshman, live without a car and rely on the bus as well as our bikes to take us where we need to go. If I were home in Los Angeles, I would be unable to bike to school due to distance and frightened to take the public bus system. Luckily, I am able to cut out a huge portion of what would be me driving around Los Angeles easily by attending school in this environment. I really wish that Los Angeles was built more like New York in the sense of a sustainable lifestyle with transportation being more of a norm. I genuinely enjoy the efficiency of taking the subway and walking from place to place, but in the area I live it's extremely difficult to do so. As sad as it is, the longer I am in this class the more hope I lose regarding people changing their actions for the planet. The more educated I am about the issues that come along with climate change and the changes that are realistically needed I see how difficult it would be to do so. Changing the stigma around cars is definitely possible, but would need to occur over many years. I do not necessarily know if we have the time for this to occur. I feel very passionately about educating people about climate change and the seriousness of the issue since I truly think that it is the only way to create the change we need to see. Many people in my generation believe that climate change won't affect them but only those that come after them. Even if they are selfish, once they are properly educated about climate change and the severity of the issue and see that it will affect them I pray that it will invoke change. Those that are naive to the issue have potential to create positive changes in their lives but truly just lack the education needed.

I totally agree with everything you said. I too, find myself losing hope. I think in the case of cars, the answer lies more in our local government than in individual people. It is impossible for everyone to ride their bike everywhere, this isn’t Holland. Our other alternative is public transportation, but as Ellie mentioned, public transportation in America isn’t sufficient whatsoever. At home, in San Francisco, I would have had to take 4 different buses to get to school, which would take about two hours, versus 30 minutes by car. The underground system isn’t much better and doesn’t even leave a small portion of San Francisco, which I needed to do in order to get to school. If better public transportation is implemented, I think way more people would use it, as Ken mentioned, cars are extremely expensive and dangerous. From a financial and safety standpoint they make no sense, but there are millions of people in our country that can’t live without them. I couldn’t wait to get my driver's license, I even got it on my sixteenth birthday exactly. I didn’t have a huge reason to start driving, but its what was expected of me, and therefore I was excited to take that step into adulthood, not knowing that it was pretty unnecessary and pointless. I also agree that it's way easier to be sustainable as a college student, as we live so close to campus and personally, I have no reason to leave. I feel less guilty now that I’m not contributing as large of a carbon footprint, but it's also sad that I didn’t consciously make that choice.

 To answer Ken’s question at the end of the video, I think we are going to need to change certain aspects of the way we live in response to the climate crisis. It’s crazy to think of the amount of hype over the last several years about electric cars and brands such as Tesla, yet in the grand scheme of things how it is simply not enough. Yes this is evolutionary technology, but it is not an evolutionary solution to the climate crisis. The truth is, cars account for about ¼ of our individual carbon footprint, meaning a change a change in the car industry would be impactful, but it’s not the only area we need to address. However, this isn’t to disregard the negative environmental impacts that cars can cause to global temperature. For instance, if we wanted to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 to 2 degrees celsius, like in the Paris agreement, each person on the planet can annually emit no more than about 2 metric tons of CO2 or equivalent gases. It’s important to note that the average car in the US emits about 4.6 metric tons of CO2 per year, meaning the average car would be emitting more than we can if we wish to make the global temperature rise to 1.5 to 2 degrees celsius. We know electric cars as “0 emissions,” so I felt quite ignorant and dumb to find out that electric cars cause more greenhouse gas emission in its production when compared to cars ran on gasoline. In the defence of electric cars, they do however only cause half the amount of greenhouse gas emissions as gasoline cars once in use during their lifespan. 
      <br><Br>
       I think it’s interesting that this issue can’t be completely solved scientifically, but it needs the help of social science as well. Ken mentions that we should have instead focused our attention on re-engineering the cultural practice of car use. If somehow we could transfer the correlation between “cool” and “car” with “cool” and “public transportation” it would be revolutionary to our carbon footprints. Unfortunately, as of today, people often associate public transportation with grimy and gross, or also associated it with the working class. I feel as though cars are often seen as luxurious materialistic items, therefore people want them because it shows a sign of success. I think that people view public transportation as full of the working class or homeless people, in other words the opposite of success. People are so determined to be seen as successful in societal standards that they make decisions that are harming the environment, when they had just as much capability of making a decision that could have caused less harm to the environment. The people who I feel most have this mindset are Americans, which makes sense. After all, the US is only 4% of the world’s population, yet the US has ¼ of the cars in the world. Most American people are so money oriented so it’s surprising how people would make the financial decision to get as many cars. If instead a spending $9000 a year to own a car you put that in your retirement account starting when you first enter the workplace in your early 20s you could retire in your late 40s instead of 65.

I agree with your comment. I feel that there is no way in which owning a car will have minimal impact on the environment. Even though Ken's video "Why the climate crisis is a cultural problem (and why electric cars are more trouble than good)." says that owning an electric car is still a somewhat better alternative to gasoline cars, they are still very harmful to the environment. Especially when owning a gasoline car is already over exceeding our maximum output of CO2 admissions. I do also agree that this culture on owning the best and most amount of cars needs to stop. Just like the previous lecture, switching to mass transportation and quitting cars can lead to a better life. In the lecture, Ken notes that you would be able to retire earlier if you were not to buy a car which would provide more leisure time for other joyful activities. I also found it very unbelievable that their are more cars than people who are licensed in the United States. This was very hard for me to comprehend because it does not make sense. This proves to show how people are buying more cars than they actually need. No matter what type of car you have, you are definitely contributing to the CO2 that is being admitted and it continues to add the more cars you have, which has become an idealistic value. Nowadays people think having a car is the coolest thing. I know I did when I was in high school and my friends were able to come and go as they pleased, but I also did not mind taking the bus. They both gave me the same amount of freedom, one just took longer, but I feel that if it is to help the earth then the extra time taken would be worth it. Since coming to UCSB, every time I have needed to go somewhere, I have taken the bus and I don't seem to mind it at all. I actually enjoy it because it is a chance for me and my friends to just sit and talk about how our day was.

 One of the details I found most shocking in this video was that really educated and incredibly intelligent people like Elon Musk believe they are mitigating the climate crisis immensely by providing the general population with affordable electric cars. As Ken mentions, although electric cars emit fewer greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than their gasoline counterparts, car production still emits an average of 2 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This is already how much we should be producing on a yearly basis! Electric cars also emit half of the carbon dioxide of gasoline vehicles. Since the average car powered by gasoline releases 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide, electric cars would logically only produce 2.3 which is still over that limit. In my opinion, this really puts into perspective how ignorant we really are about the issue at hand and how infatuated we are with cars to the point where even Elon Musk overlooks the carbon production of a car.

<br><br>

I believe that Ken is right when he mentions that climate change is mostly a cultural issue in the United States than anything else. I remember going through high school and the only thing I ever really wanted was a car to take my friends on road trips and experience more freedom. To me, it seems like the independence and convenience that a car provides is what people are really after. I think most people who don't live in cities don't want to take public transport to work because it is simply more convenient to use a car. With public transportation, you have to go to a bus or train station first before you can even start your daily trip to work. And even when you arrive at your destination, there's no guarantee that the stop will be very near your workplace so you have to walk there too. With a car, you just hop in and drive directly to a parking lot and you are there. On top of that, in a car, you have full independence, can listen to music, and privately talk to friends, something unavailable in public transportation services.

Despite the drawbacks of not owning a car, Ken makes a good point by stating that cars on average take 9000 dollars out of our bank accounts yearly. I was surprised to find out that if I invested that money in my early twenties every year I would have enough money to retire in my late forties. This really made me rethink my perspective about the benefits of abandoning a lifestyle with cars. At first, I really thought that it would be an issue because it would be an inconvenience, but the pros are honestly pretty solid options too and will also benefit our planet immensely.

I agree that there this is allusion of "green-ness" or advancement when it comes to electric cars. I think that the public including myself has been sort of sold on the idea that electric cars are the end all be all, silver bullet solution to climate change. Before coming to college I thought of electric cars as a cool innovation that were going to be helpful in curbing climate change. Now that have been exposed to how harmful they are, I have reevaluated those thoughts and I think a cultural change is what is really needed.  I also can't help but feel a little bit upset after watching this that our time and resources were funneled into (usually expensive) electric cars rather than better mass transit or transcontinental train lines. It is possible to go so far so fast via trains and I wish the US had better train transportation. 

<br><br>
I think one of the main cultural aspects of America that continually comes back to hurt us is the idea that any regulations or any change is a threat to freedom. Sure not driving a car has some detriments as you mentioned above, but think of the benefits. Taking public transit is cleaner to use and if implemented correctly can be very effective and fast. I think if changes like this were framed not as a loss of freedom as we move away from the car, but rather as a liberating experience that is better for the environment and our communities, that we would see more people interested in it.
<br><hr>
I agree. I was surprised at how much emissions are created when electric cars are manufactured. We talk about how good electric cars are but in reality they are not a major solution to climate change. Electric cars are a better alternative to gas cars but they do not compare to the benefits of public transit. You hit the nail on the head about what you said about the independence and convenience of having a car. With a car you can go anywhere, anytime. You don't have to wait for a bus or deal with other people directly. Most public transit in the U.S. is bad and not dependable. If you live in a small town a car is a necessity because you can't go anywhere without it. 
<br><br>
However, the costs of buying and maintaining a car are significant. Gas, insurance, oil, and repairs cost lots of money. This video made me rethink some things about owning a car. If I sold it, I would save lots of money but I would lose some of my independence. Honestly, if I lived in a place with reliable public transit I could probably do without a car. It would help the planet and our wallets.
<br><hr>
I agree that as a society we need to begin to change our practices surrounding cars as it would drastically reduce our carbon footprint. However, I think I do not think it is fair to label electric car manufacturers such as Elon Musk as ignorant regarding the climate crisis. Elon Musk has created cars that are so efficient they do not release any CO2. While I understand that the production of the car itself accounts for far more emissions than any car, I think electric cars are very important in our society today. At this point in time, I do not believe Americans are going to easily give up the luxury of driving a private vehicle. We have become too accustomed to this luxury and it will be very hard for many people to utilize other types of transportation that may prove to be less convenient. Therefore, the production of lower emitting and zero emission cars are very important in our society. Since I do not think we are going to deviate away from personal cars anytime soon, driving electric vehicles is at least eliminating some emissions. 
<br><br>
I do, however, believe that high emitting car manufactures are very ignorant of this problem. More importantly, I think they choose to be ignorant because they profit from harming the environment. Money is often far more important and motivating for large business owners than making sacrifices to save our deteriorating climate.
<Br><hr>

In the past few weeks of taking English 23, it became more apparent and important to me to consider that, as consumers, we are often out of touch with the process of production in some of the things we buy, and we should take into account how the idea of maintaining a certain type of lifestyle has a large influence on the decisions we make. Ken’s lecture this week made this clear. Like you, I was absolutely astonished that, despite the fact that electric cars generate half of the amount of emissions as gasoline vehicles, the production of the cars alone accounts for the lower emissions during use. Also, along with the costs of buying a car that will take years to pay off, there is also the cost of maintenance, insurance, and accident repairs. Taking these cumulative costs into consideration, it does seem more beneficial to not own a personal car.
<br><br>
I had never considered making the decision to not own a car and rely primarily on public transportation because, as you describe, I saw it as an opportunity to have my own sense of freedom in high school. In addition, my parents thought that driving myself to school every day would be more convenient when they need to run errands, drive my other siblings, and go to work. I think that this too directly relates to Ken’s argument on the cultural perspectives of owning a car because we see the idea being passed on through generations.
<br><hr>

It is definitely surprising that it appears as though even the smartest among us are prone to make horrific oversights in important issues, especially this one which is an issue largely based in science. We can only hope that either they know something that we don't. Perhaps Elon Musk succumbed to the bleak reality that a fundamental restructuring of American society and infrastructure is already somewhat of an impossibility given what we know about the effectiveness of our Congress. It is a tough pill to swallow that the best effort thus far is a fundamentally wrong approach at tackling the problem; it is thus on us as a society to take action ourselves if we wish to extinguish the threat of a 6th mass extinction.

There are certainly benefits to owning a car, especially when you're not in a position where owning one feels necessary to operate in daily life. As a current student of UCSB, I have been able to forego purchasing a car up to my 21st birthday, and after taking this class, will likely prolong this as long as feasibly possible. When it does come time to consider new modes of transport, my decision will be much more informed and environmentally conscious

 I already knew cars weren't great for the environment and were a large source of co2 emissions, but this video presented a lot of statistics and information that made me realize just how harmful car culture in the US is. I found it interesting to learn that there is a specific time period in history in which you can clearly see the rise of car culture in the US and just like many other things in our culture, it's not a coincidence. The car industry and politicians worked meticulously to make the idea of owning a car more appealing to the American public. 
<br><Br>
I've had several conversations with my mom about what it means to own a car and something she always tells me is how for a lot of people owning a car is the big "wow, you've made it in this world. you're a successful, accomplished person." We've talked about how many of my aunts have kind of bragged about their kids buying their own car. Cars have become a symbol of status in American culture, as well as something that can give you a sense of freedom. Truthfully, it'll probably be veryyy difficult to make the idea of owning a car something that's unappealing to people. 
<br><br>
Moreover, when it comes to electric cars I always thought that they were the clear choice to help reduce your carbon footprint. I always told myself that once I finally got my license and make enough money I'd buy an electric car because it's better for the environment and efficient. I'm rethinking that now....do I even want to learn how to drive? It's probably better if I just don't get a car, but I still feel a sort of pressure to learn how to drive and buy a car to be able to drive around. I think that's kind of a societal pressure that has been created in many folks partially because it's a status thing. 
<br><br>
The problem is clearly a very large-scale issue of how do we get people to not want cars? I think the answer lies in dramatically improving public transit. We need to make public transit accessible to all people. There is a very real, very political reason as to why our public transit in most places sucks (there's an episode on Patriot Act about that I would DEFINITELY recommend anyone who is reading this should watch). Most people who use public transit are poc and from traditionally low-income areas. I'm trying to find a good way to phrase the point I'm trying to convey and it's like those tweets that say "God knew I'd be too powerful if I was ___ (skinnier or smarter or whatever fits in here)" So these wealthy people know that poc/low-income folks would be "too powerful" if they had better access to public transit and consequently better access to resources, jobs, etc. I hope what I'm saying makes sense because it's hard to phrase these things. Lastly, I had a little bit of an issue with Ken saying we should "simply" get rid of cars as if it was something easy to just take out of one's lives. Many folks depend on their cars to be able to go through their everyday lives. Yes, we should get rid of our cars, but in order to be able to do that we really really need to dramatically improve our public transit and make it way more accessible to the people who most depend on it.

This comment is phrased very well. You’re right, cars have become such a huge symbol in America. It truly is one of the main indicators of wealth and “success”. YouTube is flooded with people surprising others with cars or, even more emotionally, their parents with cars. It's impressive that the automobile industry has succeeded in planting the idea in the American mind that we NEED cars. We need them to get around and show how successful we are, and we need to have a top of the line car, or else it's an embarrassment. It's absolutely false. We live in a world where a large amount of people live without cars. The video mentioned 2 billion cars to roughly 7.7 billion people. That means that a solid 5 million people are living without a car, maybe more as the top 1% typically does not just have one car. In other parts of the world, metro, bus, and biking/walking are so prominent that it is embarrassing that the United States is so far behind. We think that we are so far ahead of these other countries because our citizens can “afford” these luxury cars, when in reality we are behind in that we have not yet realized how harmful automobiles are. Furthermore, we cannot truly afford the vehicles we drive. Many people see cars as a necessity and therefore work them into their budgets, often working themselves to extremes to make their car payments. In another sense, we really cannot afford the carbon footprints our cars leave. We desperately need to change to a system of public transportation. But, as you said, “wealthy people know that poc/low-income folks would be "too powerful" if they had better access to public transit and consequently better access to resources, jobs, etc.” It's disgusting that people are so transfixed with retaining power and wealth that they are willing to do it at the expense of those trying to scrape by in a world created and directed by the wealthy.

<br><hr>

I think this comment is really deep and meaningful. I agree that cars are a symbol of status. I remember when I finally got my license, I felt so much more mature. As people began to get cars of their own, those who did not own one became a bit jealous. I myself am guilty of this. When my parents finally passed down a car to me, I felt like I fit in with society. Little did I know at the time, the rush for younger generations to get vehicles on the road is actually damaging our planet. My dream car has always been a Tesla, Besides the sleek, advanced look, I thought by driving an electric car, I could do my part to help the planet.To learn that these electric cars can actually do damage to our planet as well was really sombering. It made me realize that the only way to avoid hurting our planet the way we have been is to get as many cars off the road as possible. I have little hope for this due to societies infatuation with them; everyone wants the newest most expensive vehicles. Hopefully, as more information comes out, people can begin to realize that a boost to their ego isn't worth killing the place we call our home.

 Since becoming a student at UCSB, I have really enjoyed being able to bike to class each day while only taking the bus when absolutely necessary. When I left for school I thought I would miss always having a car to drive, and while at first I did, I now see being able to bike everywhere in such nice weather as a privilege. Another part of this lecture which stuck with me was when Ken mentioned Portland as being a hub for mass transit. As I live in a suburb a few miles outside of Portland, I agree that the difference between methods of transportation in and outside the city are extremely different. In my town, everyone I know has one or multiple cars, and nearly everyone who was 16 or older at my high school would drive a car to school even though many live less than a mile away from the school. I too, would use my car to travel everywhere at home. However, in the city, mass transit is the main source of transportation, and the people I know who live in downtown Portland typically have a family car, but still rely on mass transportation to get around. Looking at the transportation system in Portland along with how my friends and I get around here in Santa Barbara, I do really want to change how I get around when i'm back at home in Oregon. The problem I face is that in my town, mass transportation is very minimal as there are few buses that go throughout town. Along with this, most of the fall, winter, and spring are filled with rain making biking a less than optimal form of transportation. Despite this, I still completely agree with Ken in that it is a necessity to get rid of any stigma surrounding using mass transportation systems, and show future generations that cars aren't nearly as cool as society has branded them to be.

I too use my car almost everyday when in my suburban hometown in Washington state. That’s just the way things work-- when you turn 16 most kids in my small city got a car. While at UCSB I also bike to all my classes and occasionally carpool to grocery stores. This mindset is completely different and makes a huge difference in my life. I rarely exercise and biking often feels like my only source of physical activity. Now, when I go home and have to drive 10 minutes to a friend’s house, I just feel lazy. I also hope my driving habits will change the next time I return home as this video, and being at a bike-friendly campus, has opened my eyes to a different way of life.


<br><hr>
I agree with you that since becoming a student here at UCSB I have also enjoyed being able to walk everywhere or if something was a little further away I could always take the bus and it would be fine. However, back home I live in a suburban area where everything is further apart and nothing is within walking distance. I remember that the only thing I could walk to was a friends house or the nearby park but everything else was miles away. And to go to the nearest bus stop if I walked there would take me roughly 2 and a half hours so it is definitely a very different experience there than it is here. Everyone back home has around 2 cars per family which is crazy now that I know how much CO2 is distributed through our cars. I think getting everyone to lessen their use of their cars will be very difficult to achieve not only because of the  stigma that cars are "cool"  and we need to break that but also because these methods of transportation such as the bus, subway and train are in my experience a little harder to access especially in areas further from cities, which goes in hand with Ken's earlier videos urging people to live closer or within the city. Therefore, I believe that the more economic-friendly methods of transportation should be more accessible near suburbs and we would have better luck to persuade the people living closer to the city to not only stop using their vehicles but also to stop purchasing them and then we could work on persuading those living in suburban areas. That is where it will be the most difficult, but I do think that it is achievable but it would just take a lot of time that perhaps we do not have.

 Hearing all of the negative things about cars that Ken presented in this video make it hard to continue to own and drive a car miles on my own. It is interesting to think how influential cars have become in American culture and I can see the difficulties in urging people to switch to mass transportation, even though there are large monetary incentives. In previous videos, Ken has talked about how people from older generations, such as baby boomers, are resistant to change and are indignant at the idea of telling them to switch their lifestyles to fit with environmentally friendly practices, such as relying less on cars and living in smaller spaces. I think a big part of the struggle against decreasing the use and hype of cars will deal a lot with how we view them, and their “cool” factor. Growing up in a time in which eco-friendly practices and lifestyles are heavily pushed, it is easier for my generation to go in the direction of mass transportation, vegetarianism, and living in cities, as opposed to generations that grew up being taught that if they work hard for something, they deserve to have it and should be able to obtain anything through hard work and grit. 

<br><br>
My solution for weaning off cars as a mode of transportation would be primarily to invest in more reliable and safe mass transit. If buses are often late and there are not enough of them, it disincentivizes them because people cannot get to work on time, or other time-sensitive necessities, and these public services should do just that, reliably serve the people. Hearing about different projects concerning high speed rail systems, and seeing them in global cities, gives me hope that we are moving in a positive direction in terms of trustworthy transportation. I think this needs initiative needs to come local governments in big cities and urban areas because federal governments are often less effective in implementing large scale and locationally sensitive projects, since cities and counties know their area and their people way more personally than people in a different state would.

I agree with a lot of the points you makes in this comment. Cars have been sold to us from a young age as a way to adventure conveniently. I remember when I got my license and was so excited because it meant I could and get food to go whenever I wanted very conveniently. Now I realize that I was sold that belief pattern and have to change that. Living in Isla Vista is a nice way of living a low- car lifestyle because it’s so bikeable. However, the problem I have with completely going sans car is getting back and forth between school and home. I would love to take the train, but its expensive and takes a tremendous amount of time. There is the same problem with any commuter busing systems. Flying is only in cases of absolute necessity, so I opt to drive home as it is the most tangible thing I can do. 

<br><br>
Another option that I wish Ken had mentioned was carpooling. Especially as a college student, carpooling to places like the grocery store, road trips and other trips where busing, biking, or taking the train are not an option. Carpooling also saves money especially if people chip in to pay for gas, reducing the cost and making it an economical option. Carpooling also promotes a sharing economy because it does not require as heavy of dependence on fossil fuel. I want to work on getting more familiar with busing and buy a nice basket for my bike so I can transport goods more easily, but while I work on getting better at those habits, I’ll be carpooling.
<br><hr>

I agree with you in how Ken’s video made him/her feel guilty for owning a personal vehicle. Thus, it made me want to abandon my car as much as possible. Luckily, at UCSB I have no car, which allows me to rely solely on my bicycle that has zero emissions. I carpool and take public transportation regularly; however, when I move out of Isla Vista, I hope to be in a city with a well-versed transportation system, (not like Los Angeles) so that I am able to travel efficiently without leaving an immense carbon footprint. Like Erin has mentioned, the best solution to wean off cars is to offer efficient mass transit. While most New York City civilians rely on public transportation, Los Angeles civilians drive almost everywhere. This is due to the fact that LA is known to have insufficient ent public transportation, as the highways are by far the easiest method for traveling around the giant city. Erin also mentions that people stray from certain buses or trains because they are afraid they will be late for work or other “time-sensitive necessities”. Thus, it is mandatory for state governments to have discussions about becoming more eco-friendly, they need to incentivize public transportation solutions to a higher degree.

 I remember hearing the statistic that on average, cars are responsible for one quarter of an American’s carbon footprint and thinking that cars themselves are a huge problem. The electric cars becoming more and more popular and eco-friendly made me feel like the solution there was soon to be solved. However upon hearing that in order to stay under the 2 degree limit every person should not emit more than 2 metric tons of CO2 equivalent annually and that electric cars on average produce those 2 metric tons of CO2 equivalent, I see that the cars themselves are not the issue, it is the use of them. It seems nearly impossible to create cars with any less emissions, so we no longer can rely on technology to make driving “footprint friendly”. More people need to hear that electric cars in reality are not helping the issue, they are just hurting the issue a little less. For each person to stay under their "limit" and still have a car, they are left no room for eating, living in a house, or literally any other factor contributing to their carbon footprint. This means the change no longer can come from creation of better cars, but from changing habits. Honestly, I think that will be a massive challenge for our country - not impossible - but not very likely. 
<br><br>
Hearing that one quarter of all cars in the world are in America is disgusting but in no way surprising. The American mentality is to have the most and the best, which explains why at one time there were more cars than licensed drivers. Just as the Minimalist documentary stated, the American mentality is not THE template, just A template. We need to change culture in order to change action; people need to feel better about taking public transportation than driving their private car. That is going to be a challenge for most people, myself included, because it means slightly less privacy and freedom. However, I think those are small prices to pay for a more sustainable planet and home for us moving forward. New goal: make public transportation the new cool trend! (easier said than done, but we must always try our best)

It's crazy to think that just by buying a car and not even driving it every 11 years we exceed our suggested lifetime's worth of CO2 emissions. It's sad to acknowledge how much cars are embedded in the average suburban American lifestyle and how reluctant people are to give cars up. Ken made a good point in saying that people will continue to drive cars until it is no longer considered socially "cool"to have one. I agree that we can no longer rely on "footprint friendly" technology because at the end of the day, buses and public transportation have better mileage than any electric car could ever boast. What is even worse is that the car issue is very quickly becoming an issue for other countries as well. America flaunts its wealth and convinces other countries to emulate the luxury that many Americans have the privilege of living in. The fact that China's number of cars has skyrocketed in the past few decades is evidence of this. This notion of the American lifestyle and template is thus creating a ripple effect in the environment as more people buy into this mentality.   
<br><br>
That being said, in order to reverse this car issue, we need to make up for the decades of underfunded public transportation infrastructure. In a place like California, where it is practically impossible to get around without a car in the many suburbs and rural areas, we need to build more public transportation to even convince Californians to forgo buying cars. I understand the roles cars played in fueling the postwar economy, but now we need to make radical changes in our economy and our infrastructure. I also hope Americans are able to rise up to the challenge of a more sustainable lifestyle moving forward, and we'll do it one bus pass at a time.
<br><hr>

 I completely agree with you, especially your comment about how Americans feel the need to have the most and the best. If we look at our consumer culture closely we would be able to see how insane our behavior actually is. I’m still shocked that while the U.S only has 4% of the world’s population, we also have ⅓ of the cars. We should look at other countries and see how they have implemented mass transit and how many of the people in their country use it. I was shocked this summer when I traveled to Europe and discovered that not only are there not as many cars but using the bus, subways, trains, and even boats was the better option. It saved us a lot of time going from place to place and it was the cheaper option. In order to change our obsession with cars we need to change the stigma around public transportation. We waste our complete carbon allotment on one vehicle, even if it was to just sit in our driveway. It’s insane that we value our cars more than we value our own earth, which is extremely frustrating to wrap my mind around. Also, hearing Ken talk about how electric cars aren’t what many of us thought they were adds to my frustration. The public was led to believe that electric cars were the future and how efficient they are. They still use our carbon allotment in the manufacturing process. If we were to cut cars out of our lives we would have a much healthier lifestyle. Imagine having to bike or walk to work, school, home, and errands. We would also be putting less CO2 into the atmosphere. It’s a win-win situation.
<br><hr>
 I completely agree that we need to put more funding towards public transportation, but that is something that I know will cause a rise out of many people. Even though long run it would pay off financially (and of course have major benefits environmentally) all that people focus on is hearing the "more funding" part. That means more money spent right now, which gets people really upset, even though in the end it is less money. The issue is getting people to see the big picture. Just like how the Paradise Fire community didn't want to expand their roads before the fire because it would cost so much money, people now won't want to invest in more public transportation. The Paradise Fire damages cost WAY more money than the road construction would have been, but no one could think ahead. That is the same thing that is happening now. Putting funding into public transportation may mean money spent right now, but in the long run, it will be way cheaper than owning and driving a car AND it will have incredible effects on reducing climate change. The struggle is convincing people to see the big picture, act now, and be patient to see the benefits.

 I have heard a good amount of the a=variety of topics in this video before. People rip tesla all the time for "Not even being better for the environment". People also slam Elon Musk for saying he is trying to help the environment. I do not think this is postive. Why try to tear down somebody and a company who is trying to help the cause. Elon musk has started a variety of companies that are geared to help the environment. These companies include solar city, tesla, space X, neurolink, and many more. It is a waste of time for a climate advocate to spend any of their time talking about Elon is any bad light. Why tear down someone that is trying to help while all the other billionares and car companies dont care at al and still produce gas guzzling cars that are totally imported. 

<br><br>
ONLY 15% of carbon emissions come from Transportation (including cars, planes, ships). Diet and the meat and  dairy industry has much more to do with carbon emissions and a much bigger part of the carbon footprint. Climate advocates should be pushing a plant based diet 10x more than they should be slamming electric cars. Its just easy to talk about cars, but why not talk more about a plant based diet?

I agree that heavily criticizing someone like Elon Musk, who is doing much more for the environment than most are, is not a very positive or helpful thing to do. I believe that he should be praised for his attempts to at least lessen our carbon footprints through companies like Tesla and Solar City.

<br><br>
However, It seems to me that the larger point Ken is trying to make in this lecture is that while the increasing popularity of electric cars over gas-powered cars is certainly not a bad thing for the environment, a more profound change would come from a cultural shift away from cars as a whole. As Ken stated, over an average 11 year lifespan cars emit 2 metric tons of CO2 a year... just by sitting in our driveways. Being that 2 metric tons is the amount of CO2 that each of us needs to emit each year in total, it seems clear to me that our current culture of car usage just can't exist if we are going to solve this ongoing climate crisis. Furthermore, I thought it was interesting that Ken mentioned that our fascination with driving and cars does not only affect our own culture, but it also encourages developing nations, such as China, to follow in our car-loving footsteps. I believe this impact of the car culture could be even worse for the environment than even our own usage, because the growth of car culture and thus car ownership in the largest developing countries would surely do more harm to earth than any good we could do by switching to electric vehicles.
<br><br>

Overall,  while I agree that it is undeniable electric cars like those made by Elon Musk are positive compared "gas-guzzling cars that are totally imported," the topic of cars and environment should go beyond simply what type of fuel is used. We truly need to re-think our relationship with cars, or we risk not only furthering the environmentally destructive car culture in our own country, but also inspiring other countries to do the same, which is a recipe for environmental disaster in my opinion.
<br><hr>

Exactly, trying to tear down the efforts of elon musk is such a waste of time for a propenent of a clean earth. There are a million other issues out there that deserve attention and actual critisism. Sure, electric cars arnt perfect, but its a step in the right direction and a good mindset for humanity to have.

 I am unfortunately pessimistic about the future of car use. I think car culture in America and across the world is too entrenched for a massive amount of people to stop using cars soon enough to reduce emissions to the amount that we need to. Cars are simply too convenient of a mode of transportation, and they are seen as a status symbol indicating that you have enough money to buy and continue owning such an expensive item. Personally, I can't see myself not owning a car. Even if I take some other mode of transportation to work, the freedom a car provides is invaluable. That being said, I think city living presents an opportunity for people to ditch cars altogether or use them very sparingly. If cities invest in better transportation infrastructure such as metros, bike lanes, scooter lanes, etc., then people may be more inclined to only drive when they want to leave the city for a trip. For example, I am from the San Francisco Bay area and visit the city often. If I lived in San Francisco proper, I would either not own a car or invest in a small, economical car. Even if I did own a car I would drive it sparingly as parking and driving are such a hassle in the city. Bart, Muni, or rideshare are all more appealing options to get around within the city. As for new technologies, I am hopeful that electric cars and hydrogen fuel cell cars become more economical for people to buy. I think renewable and electric cars go hand in hand. A major downside of electric cars is that the charge still often comes from the burning of coal or natural gas. If large scale renewable or nuclear power is implemented, the footprint of charging your car will be diminished. However, at the end of the day, I am not optimistic that a large scale societal shift will happen regarding car use, both in America and abroad.

Sadly, I share your pessimistic outlook on the future of car use. As Ken mentions, cars have become ingrained not only in our lifestyles, but our culture. Living with my family in the suburbs, there are 6 licensed drivers in our household, and at a certain point, each of us were driving our own cars. Thinking about the carbon footprint that we are leaving on the planet makes me feel very guilty. At the same time, I can’t imagine how my parents would have worked while also driving my three siblings and me to our separate schools, sports events, friend’s houses, etc. if we shared the use of one or two cars. Referring back to Ken’s suggestions, public transportation would also be impractical in our situation. For short distances, trains are not useful, and there are no subways in the suburbs. The only option in terms of public transportation left would be buses, but it has such a small range of locations in our city that it would be nearly impossible to reach all of the usual locations in our daily life. I feel like I’m making excuses as I probably could figure out a way to bike/use the bus in order to travel around if it was really necessary, but unfortunately, cars make life significantly more efficient and convenient.
<br><br>

In the lecture, Ken also says how we must try to transform the culture of cars, rather than relying on the technological innovation of companies. In an attempt to place a positive spin on this point, Ken states how the power is in our own hands; we can make a change. However, I think the public would rather wait around, relying on technology, than be empowered themselves and have to actually take action.
<br><hr>

After watching Ken’s lecture video, I also think that cars are here to stay for the long run. First,  I was very surprised to learn that electric cars aren’t as eco-friendly as I thought they were. Ever since electric cars were presented to the market place I was led to believe that not everything was bad since our salvation was here, that we're closer to reducing our carbon-footprint, however I was wrong. I always thought how driving a regular car only exacerbates the climate crisis, but I never considered how the manufacture behind making a car, even a hybrid one, is even worse. Secondly, even though I’m very optimistic about changing the way we live our lives to help the environment, this is the first time ever that I was having second thoughts. Unfortunately, cars are a crucial part of one's life. We can definitely make public transportation easier, affordable, and even cool, but cars have been deeply ingrained in our culture that even  the younger generation are still going to purchase them. I would definite ly love for more bike use, fortunately I’ve seen more people bike to get to places but it's still hasn’t reached its full potential. Lastly,  I personally think it is easier to go vegetarian/vegan than stop using cars. Going vegan has been seen as the “cool” thing since it has been talked about by celebrities and becoming a trend on social platforms like Instagram. If there was more publication about the usage of cars as there is for a plant-based diet, then maybe more people will reconsider their mode of transportation and see that taking the bus, biking, and even walking is cool.

I think your perspective is shared by many; cars have become such an integral part of our society and lifestyle, it is difficult to fathom a world without them. From the status, to the freedom, to the convenience, cars exemplify an ideal and norm that make them necessary to many. While I concede it will be extremely difficult to implement a new way of transport, I refuse to believe it’s impossible. As you mention, if the infrastructure can support alternative methods of transport, such as bus systems, metros, bike lanes, and walking paths, choosing not to have a car will be more palatable. Form a sociological perspective, changing the way we perceive cars begins with choice; by actively lessening exposure to car advertisements, finding joy and community in public transport, and experiencing the physical health benefits of biking and walking can help to dismantle the idea of single-occupant car transport, electric or otherwise.
<br><br>

As a nation, we have developed around cars and the highway systems they require. In order to reach a no-car state, we would need to re-devise the way we plan our towns and cities drastically.
<br><br>

On the topic of technology paving the new green path humanity should follow, I am not entirely sold. I feel that innovation and technology in this field is important, for instance developing more efficient solar panels or soar energy storage cells could prove incredibly beneficial to the ecological cause; however, sole reliance on these innovations is an unhealthy redistribution of responsibility. We individually need to change our lifestyles if there is to be hope for a better, greener future.

 I am very glad Ken has touched on this issue. In general, 70-80% of the energy a consumer product will ever use, be it a smartphone or another electrical appliance like a fridge etc, will be during its manufacturing phase. So the solution of buying more things, wether they are electric or don't emit greenhouse gasses themselves is not a real solution, it's just transferring the problem from the point of consumption to the point of production. Unfortunately, when it comes to (electric) cars the minimum requirements that would make them sustainable at all is 1) the energy used to produce them and charge them comes from renewables 2) the car batteries are highly recyclable - it takes a lot of energy and precious materials to build them and the mining of these materials has a detrimental effect on the environment.
<br><br>

As a staunch believer of technology, economies of scale, and the market dynamics that these two forces can create, I have always believed that it is technological innovation that would force big corporations and governments to transition to sustainability. This stems from my belief that humans will not do the right thing unless it provides short-term profitability. I still believe that, but Ken brings up an interesting argument with the way he presents the car problem. Maybe we don't only need technological innovation, but also need innovation in education and the humanities, a sorts of spiritual innovation, sort of like the renascence, where people reassess their place in society and ultimately on planet earth and realise what their real priorities should actually be. Innovations in the humanities and sciences together could be the key to minimising the damage that climate change will create, and maximising the long-term outlook of humanity.

I absolutely agree; I also found Ken's argument interesting about how if we merely view the climate crisis as a technological issue, then we will lose the fight against it. Like you said, it is also an educational and cultural issue as well, because many people are unaware of the environmental effects of consumerism, and others consume goods that are trendy or popular among buyers. 
<br><br>
It is really depressing to see how technological innovation was originally perceived as a method to achieve sustainability, but it is more and more becoming a frontrunner to furthering the crisis. Ken brings up statistics of how China alone has an unprecedented amount of cars (1.78 million total) in 2017, and it soared to 172 million over the past 3 decades, which is an astonishing 10,000% increase. In addition, with the world's infatuation over vehicles currently, there are over a billion cars in usage; what's worse is that this number is expected to double to 2 billion in the next 15-20 years, and there are no signs of slowing down.
<br><Br>
Despite this, I liked how Ken mentioned different methods of transportation people can use. For example, taking a passenger train, subway, bus, or biking are all efficient options instead of driving. Moreover, Ken explains how driving is actually considered irrational compared to these methods because over 50 million drivers each year die or are injured in accidents, so the alternative choices are also safer. 
<br><br>
This video ultimately was eye-opening, as it shed light on the devastating impacts of cars on our planet. Many cities in the US, such as Portland and Brooklyn, are taking certain measures to produce an eco-culture, and it is imperative that we do the same.
<br><hr>

thanks for your thoughtful reply Daniel, this are all indeed great facts, and like I said in my comment I believe if we are to abandon our current way of thinking we need s real paradigm shift in terms of how we view ourselves in relation to each other, all living beings, the Earth, and ultimately the whole universe. Human consciousness needs to be elevated. Everything else will come as a result of that. Easier said than done though, especially when we are competing against all these corrupt governments and religious institutions (NOT religion itself),  big corporations and  mainstream media brainwashing people and pinning them against each other.

 This lecture video really covered a lot of information that I previously knew. I do think it's important for people to know that their electric cars still have an impact on the environment due to manufacturing. I don’t think cars will ever be “not cool” though, it's more of social standing. To some, it's about showing how much money they have or how fast their cargoes. They don’t just use a car for its purpose, getting to and from places. I think it is the ideal way for our generation to mitigate the climate crisis, but it will more than likely not happen. We have been trained to enjoy the luxury of having our own car and many of us have already been through more than one already. Another problem is that in rural areas such as Central America, there are no buses or trains that can transport you to most places. Not only does my generation have to take it upon themselves to catch a bus, but the older generations need to stop pushing their love of sports cars in their children's faces. We were raised to want cars and now we think we need them. We all know cars are bad for the environment, but we refuse to do anything about it. It is already hard enough to own the average car, imagine trying to afford a tesla. Even hybrids still take gas and most will use gas over the electricity when going over a certain mph. 
<br><br>

Now not only Americans are obsessed with cars, everyone wants their own car and maybe another one. This impact on the planet is huge and will be one of the hardest things to change. Everyone can say that the oil industry is corrupt but no one is talking about how Ford, Honda, etc. continue to make cars which also harm the environment. I think to make a difference, there need to be more commercials about taking the bus and less about buying a brand new 2020 car. My generation needs to be targeted and taught that taking the bus to the store/work doesn’t mean that you’re broke, that it means you actually care about your future. I also enjoyed how Ken pointed out the financial impact of owning a car. I think this will help convince people to reduce the use of cars and trade it for commas in their bank accounts.

I also knew a lot about the information presented in this lecture video, but I had never thought about or realized how bad of an impact producing electric cars had on the environment. I agree with that you said Meckenzie, about how cars will always be a way for every generation to show off and show how “cool” they are for having a super nice and expensive vehicle. I also feel that for our generation having a car is essential to everyday life because no one can imagine relying on public transportation to get place to place. My friend who goes to school in Texas (and is trying to be a petroleum engineer) and I got into a heated discussion about various things that have negative impacts on our planet. One of those was about the impact cars have, he argued that “I like to drive my truck places because it is easy, fast, and efficient. I don’t have to spend 30 minutes on a bus when I can get there in 10 by myself.” I tried to tell him how public transportation is not that bad because I use the bus system whenever I need to get places, and I have never been late for anything. He came back and tried to argue that buses use a ton of gas so, in reality, it isn’t better. Which obviously isn’t true, having ten people take one bus is better than ten people individually driving to the same area. Unfortunately, this is the mentality of a lot of people in America, and I find it hard to believe that these people will be changing their minds anytime soon. Now just like you pointed out rural areas do not have busses or anything, and we grew up in a small Texas town with no public transportation the only way to get around was by car, biking in my town wasn’t even an option because we lived in the hill country. The impact cars are having is insane and although it would be nice to own an electric car it is unrealistic for most Americans to own, and I am sure if everyone could afford one they would. I hate the stigma on thrift shopping or taking public transportation, our society has made these things seem like bad things if you have to partake. Which is so stupid because there is nothing wrong with it, people are afraid of being judged and looked down upon for taking busses because that is how these things are portrayed in movies and TV shows. Only characters who aren’t rich and have money to spare take busses, and it is finally time to break these stereotypes and let the public know using these services will help our planet.

<br><hr>
I personally did not know a lot of the information in this video and found it especially incredible how efficient buses trains and subways are. The information about the amount of CO2 put into the air when creating an electric car is something you don't here about and i'm not sure if that is because people do not know, or that they want to make it look like they are making a difference.
<br><br>

As for the cars being cool, I don't believe that is the main reason people have cars. While it is definitely something that can show social status, I believe that a car is much more convenient than other modes of transportation. With a car, you don't have to rely on any other schedule besides your own, and don't have to worry about getting to an type of station. I do agree that the amount of money and hassle that cars cause is enough to want to make a change toward cleaner and cheaper transportation. I'm glad I get to ride my bike everywhere I go, saving up to $9,000 a year.

<br><hr>

Personally, I thought electric cars were helping the planet but I also never intended on buying something so costly, so I'm kind of glad to hear that Teslas don't help the environment as much as we assumed they did, but I am also surprised. I do agree with your point about owning cars being linked to social status. Many people refuse to ride buses and other forms of public transportation because they are too narcissistic to mingle with people of who they assume are of lower social classes. I have heard people be grossed out of riding buses due to the misconception that they are filled with homeless folks or dangerous criminals. I feel like people will begin to trust buses once they are more informed about them. People need to know that bus drivers are trained and required to deal with anyone that may be threatening you, and there are tons of cameras. And, it is highly unlikely that you will be harmed on a bus. Most people just want to get where they're going. Two other reasons I could think of for buses being unfavorable are that they are unreliable with timings, and that they are dirty. I kind of agree with these complaints, but there are very simple solutions to these. We need to get more buses on the streets with more stops, and we need to ensure they run on time. If we had a good bus system in the United States, I am sure this problem could be solved really quickly. As for the dirtiness, we just need them to be cleaned more often. I am sure we could popularize all modes of public transportation if we just gave them a little more attention. We know it can work, just by looking at places like Japan where they have a super reliable train service. And like you mentioned, this would save us a ton of money too.
<br><br>

I also agree that people of our generation need to be targeted. I have friends who rode the bus for the first time only when they started school at UCSB, and were scared of getting lost or not knowing what to do. It made me realize that once you understand how buses work, they really aren't as terrifying as people assume. Maybe if people rode one once, they'd be comfortable riding one again.
<br><hr>
I sadly agree that it is going to take a lot to make cars "uncool". We've grown up in a society where cars are exciting. Some people wait for the day they are able to afford their own car, or the day where parents even buy their teenager a car for a birthday. This shows how there is already a positive and cool attitude towards owning a car. When Ken asked how we could make busses just as cool, I just thought back to my own experiences. UCSB students get free bus access. Being a freshman, it is difficult to bring a car to SB as well. Therefore you have the bus or bike as your transportation options. When I think of my bus experiences, I usually connected using it as a last resort or burden. No one likes waiting for the bus, rushing and being left by the bus, or the constant stops that a bus makes. Overall, busses are usually not a fun experience. I agree with Ken that we need to somehow make a social shift so that busses become cool.
<br><br>

In terms of a car's use to the climate crisis, the statistics that Ken mentioned are saddening. Just by owning a car and keeping it parked in your driveway, they already reach the 2 metric tons cap. It makes me think to the celebrities like Kylie Jenner who owns dozens of cars. We've grown up around a society that loves cars. It is ideal to travel, and nice to have your own freedom, but it is only a luxury. I think we need to discuss that there are alternatives such as the mass transportation system and bikes.
<br><hr>
I agree with you:  the need for a car is a social construct that has been passed on by generations. I went into high school with the mindset that getting my first car would be a milestone. Learning to drive and getting a car was something I just expected; it didn’t even cross my mind that it was something I didn’t have to do. I believe it is not only our job to become less dependent on cars, but to make sure we teach our children to not be dependent on cars. I think if people are taught at a young age how to use the train or bus, they will feel more comfortable with public transport systems and be more likely to use them when they are older. With this in mind, we should refrain from passing on a materialistic mindset to the next generation. We must not instill the idea that a successful life revolves around having large homes and multiple cars. 
 <br><br>
I believe Ken made a very strong argument against owning cars. As MeKenzie mentioned, Ken’s breakdown of expenses of owning a car was very persuasive. Mentioning that without a car, retirement age could go from around 60 years of age to 40 years of age was a strong appeal to the older adult audience (who are also the most opposed to shifting their lifestyle for the environment). Ken’s comment that over 500 million people have been killed or injured by cars worldwide was also very eye opening. This made me realize that I could make a list of people I know that have been in car accidents just off the top of my head. This goes to show that society doesn't realize that cars cause frequent and unnecessary danger.

 Before watching this video I always wondered what the benefits of owning an electric car was. After watching this video, I learned that they are just as bad as regular cars but not for the fact that in practice they produce more emissions than a car that runs on gas, the way these cars are made are even more detrimental to the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere. I’ve always thought technology and new innovations would be the cause of our demise but now I realize the reality of that statement. Technological advancements will not solve the climate crisis, they’ll only escalate it. Cultural changes are going to be the most important in the resolution. Public transportation needs to be normalized. It’s crazy that if you buy a car and leave it in your driveway and do not drive it, you’ve already maxed out the emissions one person is allowed to emit in your life time. This makes me think, do I really want to invest in a car? 
 <br><br>

The facts presented in this video perfectly illustrates the idea that Ken ties it together with: “we should focus on the reengineering of the cultural practice of car use”. We don’t need such a big car that will mostly be driving around one person. To me that seems so wasteful. Busses and trains have proved to be way more efficient and cost effective way of transportation. What I took away from the video is that buying cars is like an addiction. If you buy two cars for yourself, one of them is going to spend most of its time locked up in a garage. And for what? I can guarantee buying multiple cars will not make someone happier. It circles back to this idea that human beings are so dependent on material items. That’s why it’s so hard and receive so much backlash when the climate crisis comes up. People refuse to give up the lifestyle they grew up on even when we are all well aware that eventually there won’t even be a life for us to wake up to.

I definitely agree.  We have spent so much time trying to innovate our way out of the climate crisis that we have lost sight of what really matters, the culture that technology and material wants has created.  Since the post World War II industrial boom of the automobile industry, Americans have exhibited the need for cars.  They want them bigger and better than before despite the dangerous consequences to the environment, the people financially, and the danger to themselves each time they drive.
  <br><br>

What I find interesting is the fact that the promoters of the automobile industry are similar to climate deniers.  They convinced the public that cars are very cool and everyone needs them.  Similarly, climate deniers work to convince the public that climate change is not real and continuing their materialistic and emission intensive practices is not only ok, but helping the environment by offering more carbon dioxide to “feed” the plants.  That’s just plain wrong and doesn’t make sense.
  <br><br>

All in all we must reengineer our culture and what people think of as cool or “in.”  This means that mass transportation needs to be making a comeback so as to benefit not only the environment but also all those car owners who would’ve otherwise put themselves as risk and deepened their financial troubles.  In turn, this can also lead to increasing quality of life as people have more money to sustain themselves on and use as needed.  Ken’s video was very eye opening in this sense and even causes me to question: why do we really need cars now when there are so many better alternatives?
<br><hr>
 I agree with your points. Before I watch the video, I also think that electric cars can be a  good replacement for gasoline-based cars.  As Ken says in his video, during the car manufacturing process, it also emits a large amount of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. No matter it is gasoline-based cars or electric cars, they both need to be manufactured in the factories. Two kinds of cars cannot avoid huge emissions on our planet.  So it is important to realize that changing the problem from the cultural aspect is more efficient from technology investments. 
   <br><br>
Like what Ken mentioned in his video,, both the US and Europeans like to drive cars although it causes more than 50 million people injured every year. Besides the cultural reason for feeling "cool",  I also observed that in the US, it is not convenient for people to take public transportation. Driving a car is faster and freer if you go to a market or somewhere else.  If the city can invest more in public transportation, people with a better choice may take the subway or buses more often instead of driving a car.  
  <br><br>
Plus, for a cultural reason for feeling "cool",  it is undeniable.  Owning a car has been a goal for most children. Sometimes, it is a symbol of being an adult. So with the realization of such cultural reasons for buying cars, what can we do to eliminate such cultural misleading. I think that we may add some articles or research results to the textbook. If the younger generation can be educated or learn from these articles, it is much more efficient to educate the older generations and ask the older generations to change.

<br><hr>

I also didn’t know the benefits of electric cars before watching this video and it seems like there is no benefit of having an electric car over a gasoline-based car. Our world is trying to find a way to keep cars in our society and averse to the changing climate. The simplest solution as you stated is just using public transportation. Honestly, the first word that comes to my mind like most people is “ew” when I hear the words public transportation. This is just because cars are popularized and “cool” in comparison to trains and buses. Advertisements of a lifestyle of luxury and happiness is associated with having a car, or even multiple. This should not be the case; however, this is how society has deemed cars. Public transportation should be advertised more and should be located in more places for convenience. In California for example, public transportation is limited and inconvenient which makes people want a car. We are so fixated on having a car that we sacrifice our happiness to obtain one. People would be able to retire at a much earlier age and have more free time instead of working and chasing a car. Our carbon footprint from cars is so large ( ¼ of climate footprint) and people refuse to change. It doesn’t make sense that we have more cars manufactured than licensed drivers. People do not need multiple cars. We need to change our ways and use practical technology we already have.
<br><hr>
I also never really understood the point of having an electric car. For the most part, the only reason I thought people wanted them was to avoid spending money on gas, since well everyone absolutely detests doing that. It was not until I got older that I started to hear the other reason people said electric cars were better, which was because they are supposedly “eco-friendly.” But I heard about the no-gas incentive much more. But now knowing that it is not driving the car that is the primary emitter of co2, but really it is just the manufacturing of the car that we should be really worried about shows that even new tech labeled eco-friendly is not as sustainable as it may seem.  And now after watching Ken’s lecture on it, it baffles me how people, who typically want to spend as little money as possible, would invest in something so costly (and environmentally dangerous) as cars, when there are so much more affordable and eco-friendly options. The fact that people could retire at a much earlier age if they would just save the money they would spend each year maintaining a car should be incentive enough to forgo one’s car. 
   <br><br>
     But as Ken explained, people drive cars because culturally it’s the “cool” thing to do, whereas taking mass-transit is “uncool.” We really do need to shift the cultural tides and show the public that what they are doing by owning multiple cars is not cool, it’s dangerous. Whenever I see wealthy people on social media, such as Kylie Jenner, flaunt their luxury car collection I don’t think “wow” that’s so cool, I think it’s just gross. The fact that someone with that much wealth and that much influence wastes it on buying it on materialistic items such as cars while simultaneously exploding their carbon emissions to grotesquely high levels is frustrating. By feeding into this consumer culture we are not doing ourselves and the planet a great disservice. How cool will having a car be when our environment is going to ruins?
<br><hr>
Before watching this lecture video I also did not know much about the electric car and also did not know and was surprised that electric cars are just as bad as a gasoline-based car. Although I did not know much about electric cars, I always thought that electric cars were made to introduce environmentally friendly cars. However, I learned that this is not the case. I think Ken points out an important point in which the effort on this project of electric cars was wasted time in which we could have instead been focusing our attention on the cultural practice of car use. Ken mentions that it is logically and theoretically possible to transport a person from Los Angeles to New York on just 4 gallons of gas. Technologies such as public transportation, trains, and buses have proven this already. Public transportation has proven to be more efficient technologies in the case of also benefiting and cutting down our gas emissions when used. Automobiles are so popularized in the United States today and everyone is accustomed to them and sees them as a necessity in our lives. Public transportation is not a very familiarized or typical option of transportation in California especially but as well as many parts of the world. Having automobiles seems to be more convenient to many which are why our world is filled and maybe overfilled with them. People do not realize what these automobiles our doing to our world environmentally because we are so accustomed to having cars and sometimes sacrificing a lot just to obtain one. I think a good way to start cutting down on the use of automobiles and slowly switch to greater use of public transportation is to maybe limit a family to own one to two cars, rather than three or four. People do not need more than one vehicle themselves. If younger generations are introduced to public transportation and the importance of carpooling when you can, they can then be used to this new and efficient transition carrying it on to further generations as well.
<br><hr>
I too have wanted a hybrid car for quite a bit considering my car is relatively older and on its last limb. Unfortunately, I am quite guilty of driving everywhere from traveling back to Ventura to just up the street for some groceries. I am trying to make it a goal to carpool more and take my bike places though. Periodically while I am driving, I see big gas guzzling trucks and think to myself “someone consciously bought this car knowing about the climate crisis” and then I think to myself, “we are all victims of society telling us what to buy”. I think we should start talking more to our family members and friends (kindly of course) about the impact of cars.

   <br><br>

It is simple, cars will never be eco-friendly and are an environmental disaster. So, I thought it was an interesting way to put it when Ken mentioned we should make buses, subways, and trains cool. As a generation, we should make public transportation a trend. I think it will be a difficult transition but nevertheless, we can do it. I am not sure if there should be incentives (I mean having a healthy earth is an incentive alone) or if we should just try and make an effort to not use cars as much as we can. But then this brings up the problem of… well where will all of the cars go? Well, I am sure our society and generation will think of something creative and resourceful.I see a future where people are still using cars but there is a transition to hybrid cars. Unless there are policy changes within towns all over the US on investing in public transportation, or there is some kind of incentive, it will be quite the transition to having no cars. What can be done now is teaching the younger generations about public transportation. Implementing this into school could mean public transportation is the norm for these kids and they will know nothing else. Just some food for thought though.

 Before viewing this lecture I had never really considered the full scope of owning a car or multiple cars. I knew that the average gas-powered car was damaging to the environment, but the fact that it creates nearly 5 metric tons of CO2 emissions annually is astonishing. That's more than twice the amount that the average person should be emitting to keep the planet thriving. Furthermore, I had always considered electric vehicles to be, at the very least, a huge step in the right direction. However, I hadn't really thought about the environmental effects of producing those vehicles. It was mentioned in the video that production facilities for electric cars emit quite a large amount of CO2 into the air. This is important information, because people believe they are doing the best possible thing when purchasing an electric car and are not aware that they are still negatively contributing to the climate crisis. Not to mention that cars are also a large financial expense. Paying for gas, repairs and other expenses can run up large bills. It's strange that something like a car that weighs so heavily on our wallet and environment can continue to be such a huge part of life.

Cars, and the unnecessary abundance of them across the world, clearly need to become less sought after. They are a huge financial and environmental burden and their reputation as the best mode of transportation needs to be put to bed. As Ken mentioned in the lecture, social scientists need to devise a way for cars to be less cool and buses, trains and bike riding to be seen as the best set of options. In a time where the climate crisis is already creating catastrophic damage, priorities need to be shifted from being cool car owners to environmentally aware bus and train riders. Although this solution is so clear cut, the real, ever present question is: how on earth do we facilitate that change?

I think that we can facilitate change in the same way that Post WW2 manufacturers did to make cars cool, although it will be much harder to make cars uncool. As opposed to Eisenhower and his highways, maybe make bicycle-friendly paths more available. Make more public buses have WI-FI, not just the ones on freeways. Make subways and trains more accessible and user-friendly (I still know many people that do not know how to use public transportation, but are excellent car drivers). Having a car, or multiple cars, are seen as a status of wealth, so maybe let's make it not by making buses and bikes cool. Remember how the "hoverboard" took the U.S by storm? at least until they started to catch on fire? Maybe have something like that but much more eco-friendly and trendy and I'm sure we will get rid of cars for good.
